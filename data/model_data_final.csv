I’m looking for games that scratch the same itch as Breath of the Wild, Divinity Original Sin 2, and Streets of Rogue. Basically games with a consistent set of rules the player uses to achieve their goals, even if it is in the most insane way possible. 

I’m aware of immersive sims but have never played a true one so recommendations for those are welcome but also anything where if an approach seems like it will work it probably will are good too. Thanks!",1

I have a couple concerns though that I hope reddit can help me answer:

&#x200B;

1. Price. The original reason I got an Xbox One instead of a PC was because there was an Xbox at my local GameStop for $180, which was perfectly within my price range. I'm looking at PCs online and seeing $600 or more for pretty much all of them. Is this the price that it'll actually cost, or am I just missing a lot of options? Because I can afford that, I'd just have to wait another monthish to do so and obviously I would rather not spend a ridiculous amount of money on gaming. Also, is a $600 PC going to be good or should I expect to get a shit quality machine for that price?
2. Upgrades. Another main reasons I like console is because the developers make their game fit a specific platform, you don't have to worry about upgrading your console to fit your new game. But on PC, it seems like there's a new CPU or GPU every six months that everyone clambers to get, and I really don't want to spend $1,000 on the next must-have piece of hardware every year.

&#x200B;

So, if I upgrade to PC, how can I get a solid computer that will run everything I want it to smoothly without breaking my bank account?",1

69,"I’ve finished Red Dead Redemption 2 twice now, and I want to share my thoughts with you guys. **DISCLAIMER: SPOILERS**

First of all, I want to address all the people who are thinking *’Only the the second time? Pfft.  I’ve finished it 15 times’*.  I picked the game up in late July, this year.  So I have only finished it twice now.

The first time I played the game, I focused on the main story missions only.  So, I missed out on things such as Marko Dragic and Brother Dorkins’ missions among many more.  I feel as though these made me feel a lot closer to Arthur, and it felt weird knowing what eventually happened, but still dreading it and hoping it wouldn’t happen.  Arthur Morgan is a great man, and I speak of him of a man - not a character - as I feel he is more than just a protagonist in a video game.  Knowing that ‘Arthur dies soon’ in chapter 6 was heartbreaking.  I’d experienced it once, and the first time I was pretty sure it was going to happen, but I wasn’t sure.  The second time around, I was vaguely remembering which missions were getting me close to the end.  I’d watched Arthur essentially kick Strauss out of camp and heard Uncle mention his *LuMbAGo* more times than ever.  I watched as Arthur recommended Trelawny leaves when he did, as the place was quiet.  I’d watched the gang fall apart and my heart ache; it felt as though it wasn’t a gang anymore, it was family.

Writing this during the credits having just killed Micah means I want to reflect on individual gang members.  On my first playthrough, I still had hopes that Dutch would turn out fine after Micah had seemingly taken control of him.  On my second, however, I realised exactly what Micah was doing in about Chapter 2.  My hatred for Micah must have multiplied by about 10 and my feelings for Dutch worsened, but I felt sorry for him at the same time.  I could tell that Micah was manipulating Dutch, and that Dutch couldn’t tell until it was too late, on the mountain, just before Arthur dies.  I felt more betrayed than ever when Arthur finds out that Molly never talked, but Micah ‘was a good boy ever since he got off the boat’.  Molly died in vain, Miss Grimshaw shouldn’t have killed her at least until she sobered up.  I felt more sorry for Rains Fall when Eagle Flies died.  And to think that the only reason Eagle Flies died was because Dutch was going to leave Arthur for dead was agonising.  Then he did the same with John, while lying about the fact that he was dead, and ‘there was nothing he could do’.

Knowing what happened made me closer than ever before with everything in the game, including my horse.  I was upset the first time Arthur died, but I was nearly crying the second time.  Building John’s house was the only time I could stop thinking about Arthur the first time, but this time even that couldn’t stop me.  I was attached to the game the first time.  But the second time around, I couldn’t even stop thinking about it.  If I got bored and turned the game off, all I wanted to do was go back and play it more.

Red Dead Redemption 2 is perfect, and that’s all there is to it.

I will now start the first one.  And probably enter a never ending loop of Red Dead.  Thank you if you read all of this, and if you didn’t, well, Uncle will give you Lumbago.  Probably.",1

I start with 3 games that I discovered this year but took about 300h of my life.

First one is Kenshi, might be the less underrated according to its sub but still deserve ever more interest. Plot is quite simple, take a post apo alien world, 4 major factions and handful of secondaries, and drop you, a total POS, in it. Fight, explore, craft, make enemies, friends and survive this (very) unforgiven world

Second one is Darkwood, the first game that really made me shit my pants. A grim forest, a curse, unseen threats, a little base slightly safer than the outside, survive and find an escape day by day and hopefully not by night

Last one is Reus, after the 2 first Reus is good, Reus is sweet, Reus is peace. On a circular little planet harness the power of 4 giants, Ocean, Forest, Rock and Swamp. Grow mountains, create oceans, spawn deers in the forest and emeralds underground for the little people living on your land to prosper, but careful they might try to attack their little neighbors with better lands or worst, your giants

I'm not sure everyone wants to grind out these games just to be told they have to be cracked out focused on doing certain tasks while communicating with loud younger kids or spergs in general, and if they don't want to do that, they essentially have wasted their time playing these games. 

But why has the idea of raids been implemented in so many of these games, and why does the younger generation seem to love them so much?

103,"GTA Character Idea: Richard Valentino/The Red King (Crime Lord and Villainous Protagonist) This is not an official character in the GTA franchise, but I figured I could pitch an idea for an anti-villain/villainous protagonist. In the future, I plan to make a GTA web series with this man as the main protagonist. Richard would also be the main protagonist of all of the heists (Fleeca Job, Prison Break, Humane Labs Raid, Series A Funding, Pacific Standard Job, Doomsday Heist, Diamond Casino, Diamond Casino Heist, A Superyacht Life, and Cayo Perico Heist).

Richard Valentino (aka The Red King), successful businessman, founder and CEO of Valentino Enterprises, founder and leader of the Masquerade Mafia. He is a notorious crime lord bent on ruling all of Los Santos and immortalize his name as the greatest criminal mastermind in American history. Despite his villainous occupation, he has a tragic backstory which revolves around his motives. Due to his tragic backstory, he is a very sympathetic character. 

&#x200B;

**Richard Valentino/The Red King**

* ***Goals:*** 

1. Rule the entire city of Los Santos.
2. Become immortal by being forever remembered as the greatest criminal mastermind in American history.
3. Get revenge on everyone who treated him horribly in the past.

* ***History:*** Richard Anthony Valentino Jr. in an American male of Italian ancestry. When he was a child, Richard lived with his mother and father. The family loved each other very much. However, his father Richard Valentino Sr., was facing financial problems and worried he wouldn't be able to provide for his family. So Richard Sr. turned to crime in order to support his son. He went from smuggling to robbing banks. Until he was finally arrested for his crimes. Richard Sr. was sentenced to death by the electric chair. As he saw his wife and son looking back at him one last time, his last words were ""I love you both."" Richard Jr. watched his father die for providing for his loved ones. Richard Jr.'s life had gotten a lost worse afterwords. He was always bullied at Elementary and Middle School by all the popular kids for his family not being rich and famous (it's a social status thing). Until one day, the kids apologized to Richard and asked him to be their friend. One week later, Richard was invited to join a club with the popular kids. Richard's mom saved up enough money to buy Richard a fancy suit and bow-tie for his initiation. Later that night, as he entered the clubhouse, the popular kids reveal that they only pretended to be his friends just so they could humiliate and beat him up. One of the kids even gave Richard a black eye. He escaped while the other kids mocked him and teased him in the rain. Richard lost the only happiness he had ever had in a long time. Richard sat in the rain crying, waiting for his mom to come pick him up. From that day forth, Richard swore that he was never going to be pushed around again. He vowed that one day, he would be the one on top and in charge of the city that wronged him. In his 20's, Richard began to build his fortune and start a company. Richard had become a billionaire and businessman. However, this was just a cover to hide his true line of work. Richard started a criminal empire called the Masquerade Mafia, known for always wearing masks when committing crime. Richard went under the alias ""The Red King,"" a mysterious kingpin bent on ruling the entire city. Richard became one of the biggest crime bosses in the criminal underworld. Nothing would stop him from claiming Los Santos as his own.

* ***Personality:*** Richard is a broken man. Only knowing anger and sadness. After his traumatizing life as a child, Richard became severely depressed. Even becoming an alcoholic. To the public, he is an average billionaire playboy who threw and went to parties, drank, and so on. As the Red King, he was a cruel, remorseless tyrant bent on taking over the city and getting revenge on everyone who wronged him. Despite his thuggish tendencies and tyrannical nature, Richard is not completely heartless. Although he is a ruthless mob boss, Richard had a moral code. Richard would never do drugs (even though he deals drugs from time to time), he will never kill anyone unless necessary, he will never murder children or their parents as they remind him of himself when he was younger, believing them to have it lucky. Richard also despises abuse of any kind (Animal abuse, Child abuse, Domestic abuse, etc.) Richard is also disgusted by rape, pedophilia, sex and human trafficking, etc. Richard is still capable of love and kindness. This is proven as he treats his wife like a queen and loves her with all his heart (even hoping to have a child with her one day). Richard is also a kind boss towards his employees and his goons. Richard is also extremely intelligent and incredibly strategic, carefully planning his heists and orchestrating missions to steal the things needed to prepare for the heists.

* ***Appearance:***

1. **As himself:** Caucasian, well built ans semi muscular, no facial hair, brown eyes, black faux hawk haircut, gray suit vest, black scruffy suit pants, and all black canvas shoes.
2. **As the Red King:** Deadeye Warrior Mask (with built in voice changer), black suit vest, red wool coat, black gloves, black scruffy suit pants, and all black canvas shoes.

* ***Crimes:***

1. Mass murder, Racketeering, Organized crime, Torture, Terrorism, Theft, Destruction of public property, Arson, Drug dealing, Weapons dealing, Blackmail, Mutilation, Incrimination, Con artistry, Smuggling, Vandalism, Robbery, Money laundering, Conspiracy, Fraud.

* ***Type of Villain:*** Tragic Crime Lord.",1

109,"Secretlab Omega chair with PU Leather 2.0 Review I recently purchased an Omega chair from Secretlabs and thought I'd give it a bit of a review. I have looked at reviews of this chair before and decided to make the jump to find out for myself. I ordered it in black PU Leather, with red stitching, and the gold embroidery.

Price

I bought it just over a week ago so there was a bit of a sale on their site. Regular price is $499 CAD so its definitely not cheap. For the price you're paying, the quality better be there! There are similarly priced chairs that aren't necessarily gaming chairs, but I liked the look and felt that spending that amount was a risk i was willing to take. 

Shipping

YMMV. Within a week of ordering I received my chair through Fedex, and it arrived a day earlier than expected. I ordered on a Thursday, and the chair arrived Monday just after lunch. It was originally slated end of day Tuesday. Quite amazing, considering there is a christmas rush to deliver packages, there was a winter storm warning during that time, and all this was going on during the pandemic. Very pleased with that.

Packaging

I did watch a lot of youtube unboxing videos so I wasn't surprised to see the contents and packaging. It is a fairly heavy box and may need 2 people to carry it comfortably. Each component was compartmentalized, and packaged nicely. The chair back and seat assembly were the biggest pieces in this very sturdy box. It came with the giant posterboard instructions, with no pieces missing. The head and lumbar pillows were packaged as well. Nothing unusual to report.

Assembly

Instructions were easy to follow from the poster that comes packaged. Lots of pictures with step bybstep instructions that are very easy to follow. It comes with an allen wrench and a magnetic bit driver with a phillips bit for you to use for assembly. It can be put together by one person if you are handy. 2 people are recommended, just for some parts like lining up the high back with the seat assembly. It took me less than 30 minutes from unboxing to complete assembly. Definitely follow the instructions on the poster that comes with it to have little to no trouble. I would suggest to start the supplied screws in by hand, and not by the tool to prevent crossthreading. That is the last thing you want to happen after spending the amount of money for this chair. 

Comfort

The chair feel is very firm, but it is exactly what I was looking for. I am not a fan of plushness, and the extra firmness doesn't bother me at all. I do expect the firmness to soften up over time, but brand new, the feel is perfect for me. I'm 5'7"" and around 165lbs currently so im not a very big person.

I do have to have the seat at the lowest position, and when i tilt the chair or recline, my feet are dangling over the edge of the seat. I have a foot rest that i am using and find that helps a lot. I went for the smallest sizing according to the site's size chart and the Omega is almost the right size for me. 

I do like the myriad of adjustments for the armrests and tilt. The head pillow has an adjustable strap and is easily adjustable to where you wnat it to sit on the high back. The lumbar pillow gives additional support for you if you want it as well. It is not as firm as the seat so compresses nicely, and doesnt feel like its pushing you to the edge of the seat.

Everything feels very solid, and the quality is everything i expected out of my purchase. It looks and feels great, and there are a few areas that have some carbon fibre accenting to add to the finish of the chair. I do not have any buyers remorse at all and feel pretty confident i made the right choice. I have sat in it for several hours trying different positions including the full recline. So far, no issues with discomfort. I do sit cross-legged sometimes, and I find that I am still comfortably able to do that despite the racing bucket seat shape. I am very impressed and happy with my purchase. Its hard for me not to recommend this chair, but it really depends on what you are looking for. Its a big risk to purchase a chair without sitting on it, so if you could try it out from someone before you buy it, I would recommend that.

I will update this in a couple of months to update how it holds up. Hope you found this review helpful, if you made it to the end, thanks for reading!

132,"Why have so many games released in recent years, in terrible condition or seem to have been barely tested? I dont say this to be salty or mean or anything. There have been some real gems in recent years too. But I can definitely name a lot more massive flops than massive hits. Cyberpunk 2077 has just been the apex of everything bad that could have happened and its seemingly terrible condition makes me want to ask this. This isn't specifically about cyberpunk, but also how games like fallout 76, and star wars battlefront 2. All 3 of these games had the perfect conditions to have been capable of becoming amazing games. Plenty of time for development, lots of money, and a devoted fan base. And yet all three still came out practically unplayable. This shouldn't be happening AT ALL had anyone playtested the game, they would have VERY quickly caught a lot of the bugs. Even just a single playtester probably would have made a good chunk of the commonly complained about bugs known about before the game had been released. You can't even argue about executive pushing things being the sole reason because all of these games also had plenty of time to be worked on and very large teams. Im not saying I'm expecting perfection, but I at least expect to buy a game and be able to play it without stormtroopers flying into the stratosphere everything I kill them. it almost seems like games are being intentionally released untested to save money or something.",1

153,"So I finally played Resident Evil 3 Remake a few days ago and this is what I have to say... [Game Review] So, I finally played Resident Evil 3 Remake a few days ago and here is what I have to say. 

Let’s start with the bad things.

Nemesis is a joke in this game. Shoot him a few times or throw a grenade at him and he drops down and gives you upgrades that you can get to become even more powerful. I’m all for rewards in survival horror games but there has to be some challenge in it otherwise, just no. Mr. X in RE2 remake was a better Nemesis than RE3 remake Nemesis, damn what a bummer. And the OG Nemesis in my opinion is the scariest monster in the entire franchise which makes it even worse. 

There is also too much ammo in this game making this game almost like a third person shooter and most of the puzzles have also been removed. Talking about removed content, cutting out the Grave Digger, the clock tower, brain suckers, the park, graveyard, open world gameplay elements, the mercenaries and what ever else I missed won’t help me appreciating this game more, what a disappointment when compared to the Resident Evil 1 Remake that just added content. 

Brad wasn’t killed by Nemesis, Dario is even more one dimensional as he was in the original RE3 and Jill doesn’t even go to the police station. Speaking about Jill, I don’t like her new look. Why not simply stick with the old face model? I really don’t understand. She looks like a friggin minor in this game. Also, Capcom wanted to ground RE3 Remake in realism but Jills new outfit doesn’t make any sense. She wanted to leave the city two days after so why wearing jeans? Better yet, why is she sleeping wearing jeans and boots. A skirt like the one from the original would be more appropriate for sleeping, don’t you think? I also don’t like how they changed Nikolais motives. In the original he killed the other supervisors for an extra pay check and also out of Umbrellas orders if I remember correctly. In the Remake he is working for someone else who hasn’t even been revealed, who according to Nikolai paid him to take down Umbrella. What a silly unnecessary change. BTW Jill holding that rail gun that is 10 times her sizes and shooting it without being crushed by the recoil makes me cringe and feel Vicarious embarrassment every time I watch it and it makes Chris punching boulders look so normal. Who ever came up with that idea should get fired or better yet, who approved it. Also Barry… where is Barrry?

Now let’s talk about the good things.

Graphics, voice acting and visuals have improved but that could have been expected and the cutscenes are also more cinematic, which is one of the main reasons I wanted remakes of RE2, 3 and CV in the first place after RE1make made a game with zombies and mutants looks like an art house film. 

While I don’t like Jill’s look, they handled her personality very well. Who needs Sarah Conner and Ellen Ripley if you can have Jill? She has a strong personality and lots of charisma which I like. That’s how you do a great female character.

I like Carlos more in RE3 remake than in the original. He also has lots of charisma and some damn good one liners. I also like his story ark with him getting to know why Jill views Umbrella in such a bad way and why she wasn’t trusting any of the U.B.C.S. The hospital setting with Carlos was also better than in the original. 

The Hunters are back and better than ever. They got their infamous instant kill and are the scariest enemy in the game. That one scene where you can look out the window and see that Hunter tearing that Zombie into pieces gives me the chills. 

Additionally, the game got some nice unlockables giving it some good replay value.

Tyrells role got extended which is a good thing because in the original he was just an extra, you couldn’t even call him a character.

If this would have been an movie adaptation from the original Resident Evil 3 it would have been the most faithful and the best movie adaptation of all time as while I don’t like most story changes the one in the remake is still pretty damn good but at the end 18 years of long wait wasn’t worth it. If I would give this an review score I would give this game and 7.5/10. It’s good on it’s own merit but a disappointment when compared to the original.",1

Since September, I’ve been working 60-75 hours a week each week, allowing myself to get financially stable enough to be able to treat myself to the Nintendo switch, Xbox series X, and (for the first time in my life) the brand new PlayStation. For perspective, up until September the only consoles I had were my N64 and my Xbox One that I bought in 2015 two years after its release. 

I knew I wanted to get the switch, and was so hoping to get a PS5 to finally enjoy the entire Sony catalog that I’ve never had a chance to play, but the series X was the icing on the cake. I knew it’s the most strong console of the new gen but just figured I wouldn’t bother since I’d hopefully get a PS5 and be content with that, but I realized I was more than able to get all three (and after some persistence all at face value!) so now I can enjoy all this new gen has to offer! I finally will be able to try every game available for consoles and not be bummed about any console exclusive.

Been lurking for a real long time and this post is due.

I am turning 40 soon and worried how my love for video games has been on the decline as of late. I have been playing video games since the Atari and Commodore 64 days and have had all then consoles. I’ve been PC gaming since 1994 and played FPS and Sports games throughout time mostly. From early counter strike days to the first releases of Rainbow 6 on PC. I miss those gaming days. Unreal Tournament, Quake. Those were my jams!

I got real hooked on Left 4 Dead and spent thousands of hours on that franchise. If only something like that came out again and I could play a game mode like Scavenge. I was real good at that.

Just reaching out and seeing what people recommend. I played WOW, C&C:RA and Warcraft back in the day but never stood by those genres in the last 20 years. Just dabbled here and there.

I know this year has been hard and we had more time to spend at home and get spoiled or bored. I just don’t feel like the love for games will come back at this point.

If you wish to share your side on things I’m all ears. I’ll even take a game recommendation if you got them.

I’m trying to find an old pc game from around the early 2000s. It was an educational game used to teach the alphabet or basic numbers, I’m not really sure...

The aim was that you drove around a map as a car with a human head sticking out of the top trying to find the correct letters and numbers. I specifically remember that one of the player models was a pink and purple car with a girls head...and another on that was orange and blue or green and had a boys head...

I think there was voice acting but that’s really blurry in my mind...

I’m not sure how accurate my memory is, so the details may be a little off...

210,"The Most Intense Gaming Experience In My Life For you all that have not played Frostpunk, it is a classic management game that will scratch the itch for a strategy game, but also have a unique twist, it is filled with scripted storytelling and decisions. Which make it one of the most unique and best experiences there is, and for the same reason hurts its replayability. See [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqEpSOFDXGA).

Jumped into Last Autumn DLC on Survival mode, which means the game is on extreme difficulty, ironman and the game cant be paused(else you can micro everything paused, very powerful stuff) Now rather, most of the planing can be done when the workers sleep, micro during the day hurts productivity of the workers.

Holy hell, I  was unsure on all of the new content all and all, going blind into a DLC in ironman is risky. You can explore a wasteland, order working bodies from England through telegraph and create a colony to construct humanities last lifeline before the sun darkens. A project to create a huge and rugged coal burning generator that will warm the last survivors. All set in an alternative industry revolution era/steampunk setting.

I made strategic mistakes, I ordered too much working men and the wrong goods before the ice struck and made the supply lifeline to the main land blocked.So  I sat with stage 3 of 4 for mission complete, a generator nearly finished. 9 days to go until it has to be done. 250 population, a hundred dockworkers unemployed and too much coal. I never and would never upgrade  anything but braziers and some upgrades to braziers in the temperature tech tree, foreshadowing.

I thought I was a goner, I  am usually good at strategy games, but it looked I made the wrong  decision, I might have too many to feed and too many beds to warm now. And I never knew that it would fall to -60 degrees Celsius. I ordered all the extra bodies since I figured I would have to work them to death in toxic working conditions in the fourth and last stage of the project, but the toxic fumes are apparently only in game for stage 1-3.

I had much of all resources apart from steel, and this was planned, since i knew that I could cut up a stranded ship far away once the ice came. And boy did winter come.

The  shipwreck did not yield steel fast enough for the last parts of the generator shell, and I had to deconstruct 80% of the city for the steel,  or else risking not finishing the work in time. The storage, docks and workplaces were not needed now anyhow.

The rest of  the city I had to reconstruct, spread out hospitals were not working in the cold, cooks did not work either, had to clump them together with a  warm brazier, but once the brazier was done the temperature had  dropped even more, the hospitals/cooks did not work anyhow.

After all braziers were done I saw then that my huge coal reserve that would last me a month before, would now only last 15hours, and still had many days of work left. For what felt like eternity I  turned braziers on and off constantly, moving buildings and piling bare  workers on small cold coal piles still left at the old deconstructed docks. Until now only 4 were dead, a city of 260population. Now hundreds of sick, people  dying in masses every minute and I still had much to do, the church bell  ringing for the dead was a constant rhythm to the music the final hour, and the game cant be paused to help one get an overview.

And boy is the music good in this game, ramps up along the with the coming endless winter.

Worker motivation had been until now as high as it can get, high and addicted to cocaine, good food, labor unions and church masses, along with fancy funerals. But then with mass deaths, motivation fell through the  floor. Crackdowns with the communist militia on 2 revolts, and the third could no longer be cracked down for some reason, and I was forced to pick the option of restoring discontent within 2 days. The first rebellion day42 scared me into finally taking what I had yet not done, TERROR policy. So the motivation was up again from public executions, executions that I could no longer control even from now on, the extra work speed could maybe save me as well.

When the generator was  3% away from done...STRIKE, I don't remember how I solved it, I had a  thousand raw food but no meals as bribe duo to the temperature. I had to  research charcoal rather than temperature upgrades as my last research,  for a chance of survival, burning up all buildings apart from the tents.

220dead from cold and selfless sacrifice, no better than slave labor, the labor union bribed. I am microing short  shifts for 10% efficiency into long shifts every day (To my surprise,  which the workers noticed and complained). Filling up the generator workspace with more bodies when I can and notice during the day, since its losing  bodies fast, lucky I had ordered the extra 50 bodies and had all that  extra coal after all.

On the last  day my chief engineer was executed for stepping on the militias toes, so he was blamed for old faults on the generator as an excuse. The music  has been pumping, and finally I made it, so I thought, the generator  done day44, 3 executions all in all, its 3am in the morning IRL, I stood up from adrenaline, I read the end screen and understood I still had to wait for evacuation a day away. OH, NO!

I  looked over at the mission table and saw that evacuation is coming in  23hours, and my promise to restore order has to be complete by.....1 day  and 4 hours away.

Can this be it I thought, will I make it? Or can I lose by some other mean? City in as much chaos as it can be.

Evacuation  came, 30 workers evacuated. 240ish workers/engis dead. 5hours away from  defeat.

Finished without permanent damage to the generator, but no extra upgrades, enough for 500 people with poor chance of making it. I am sure others have done better, but I had the greatest frostpunk  experience.",1

What made me lose absolute interest in this game was the hour long+ transition from the end of the initial heist to the start of the actual game. All the cut scenes that were a few seconds long and then waiting for the next one to load. Or the forced interaction that did not help the immersion, like crawl forward 10feet for no reason so the cut scene can progress. Or here shoot this one guy on a bike while being driven then wait for the on rails action to end. Terrible writing and terrible execution.",1

I can't wrap my head around the anger surrounding these two titles. I played both at launch (on ps4) and they are among my favorite games ever! Both are beautiful, innovative, and complete wonders of masterful storytelling. These games obviously have so much love put in them by the Devs and for totally different reasons these games have been roasted on social media. It's especially frustrating given how insane this year has been and for me these two games were among a precious few highlights that gave a much needed break from reality. 

While the hate for Last of Us 2 has calmed now it's still crazy to think how brilliant and polished this game was. It took a unique approach to storytelling and made you question everything you knew about right and wrong. It's execution was spectacular and many people were focused on the fact it didn't meet their expectations for the characters (no spoilers). Newsflash: I game SHOULD challenge your expectations! That's what made this game so brilliant.

Thank you Naughty Dog for creating my favorite narratives in a game ever!

Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the most anticipated games ever and for good reason. It was a game that promised a lot and honestly it delivered on the overwhelming majority of those things. It took me 50 hours to get the credits to roll in Cyberpunk and even playing on a launch edition PS4 this game was full of endless wonder. There's so much to do and all of it is built with care. It's the best of fallout (plus your character actually has a voice) combined with GTA type world but in the future and your character is more invested in the overall happenings of that world. It has a unique plot and branching decisions that actually have a huge impact beyond good/bad endings decided in the final moments. This game continually made me question if I had made the right choice because it actually mattered. I never felt like a passenger on someone else's story. It felt like it was my own and that's a rare experience in gameing. 

I did run into bugs and crashes on occasion, but the crashing was fixed with the day 2 patch and the bugs have been little more than annoyances. Only a couple times did I need to reload saves because my progress was blocked. I have every faith for this to be fixed in the future. Remember this game was finishing it's development and release during a global pandemic and the pressure from to release in 2020 resulted in a game with some issues. I loved this game and am nowhere near done with it. I can't unstand why people can't let the little things slide and enjoy all of the wonderful things this game provides. 

Thank you CD Project Red for creating one of the best open world RPGs I've ever played.",1

That's not going to happen, so I'd be grateful for any recommendations on what to play. I am looking for a relatively big game that I can get lost for hours in (and forget about the lockdown). I am running a Linux laptop and playing through steam's proton. 

Here are some of the games that I have already played (and loved) Witcher 3, MGSV, Middle earth series, Arkham Series, Neir: Automata, Bioshock series, Assassin's creed Odessey and origins.

I want to play Skyrim but from what I can tell, it might have issues when running with proton on an Xbox controller. Which is how I am hoping to play. 

I considered RDD2, and horizon zero dawn but they both aren't expected to that smoothly with proton either from what I can tell from ProtonDB. I know RDD2 has gold on proton, but the comments aren't that reassuring. 

I also really enjoyed Ori and Hades but right now, I am looking for an easier time.

I remember that the game was either announced 2018 or 2019 and was supposed to be released either 2019/2020 or 2021. 
The game is kind of a horror FPS where a team of (i think) 4 or 5 players barricade themselves in a building, very similar to rainbow six siege. Their opponent (dunno if AI or by a player, altho i think the last) is a Monster that is supposed to kill the barricaded players.

It makes the value of the other characters feel a little arbitrary, to me. Like you'd play them when you're doing sidequests because you're bored of Shulk, and not because they're stategically viable.

I need some help with a nostalgic PS2 game I play, It's called The King of Route 66, originally an arcade game created by SEGA am2 in the early 2000s (I remembered them in my local bowling alley) and came on the PS2 around 2002 I believe. It's also the sequel to 18 Wheeler: American Pro Trucker.

This may be a long shot, but does anybody know how to unlock the orange border question marks? The red borders are rival truckers you race against and green are civilians you meet along the main story.

The game could also include encyclopedias detailing events of the empire, the different territories and parts, ethnic groups, locations and sites!!!

&#x200B;

There would be various types of animals to hunt such as lions, rhinos, tigers and all that based on where you travel to with local villagers and guides helping you out! trade investments would also be a feature as well as a mechanic that allows you to learn languages, when you start of in regions you have a translator and eventually you will be able to pick up languages. Quests in parts of India can give you enlightenment points which have to do with statistics and all that, other features include mounts like elephants and even camels, sports like polo, chess and expedition missions that allow you to adventure to portions of unexplored territory with groups of NPCs!! a Indian city near the ports would also be cool!!!

There really isn’t a game out there that can be dove into now correct me if i’m wrong.

          **SPOILERS INCOMING**(+Bad English)




 5: Wind Waker

despite having great music, windwaker's dungeons are just not that great.. The only dungeon that was somewhat memorable was probably dragon roost cavern, It just that it didn't feel like I was enjoying the process, I just wanted to be done with it and get to the boss.

I was also really disappointed with the game having no underwater levels, when you know the game is about you sailing, you would except at least one water based dungeon or something. Honestly I don't even remember if you can swim in the game, I don't remember any moments where it was ""required"".

Despite all this, I still think this is great game.
The overworld felt really ""open"" specially when go sailing for the first time, feeling all lost and confused... Definitely the strongest point of the game. 

I also like the parrying, even though it's not really ""parrying""



 4: Skyward Sword

I had ALOT of fun with this game, I take the flying through the sky over sailing any day! I don't know why but storywise this game felt more ""engaging"" not mention the amount of unexpected stuff that happens in the game.

Earth Temple has to be the worst Zelda dungeon that I played, when I come across a bad dungeon most of the time it ends up having a great end boss. Earth Temple? Both were terrible, but you know what comes next? Sandship baby, this is what I learned from playing Zelda, the longer... the BETTER. the whole search for the ship was pretty lengthy and i loved every second of it, already in a great mood, but then you get to the actual dungeon, and it's even better! All great for a cold windy early afternoon...

Fi wasn't nearly as annoying as I thought she would be. I know this might sound weird... But when her text is written out on the screen it's in a weird way as if it's being written faster then what's actually being shown to the player because of the after trail that appears before it's written, it fooled my brain and I never got annoyed of her dialogue. Smart move Nintendo!

the motion controls were annoying, but only on specific cases...
slingshot,bow,hit your bird on the things bullshit minigame,playing your harp while the girl sings minigame?

Some of the bossfights were amazing, koloktos for example probably best boss in the game proves that a boss doesn't need to be difficult to be a blast to fight.


  3: Majora's Mask

My first impression of Majora's mask were extremely off-putting, mainly because I was stressed from the time running out.
""look at those npcs go, I want to talk to them. With, what am I doing? Oh no timer is going so fast!""

The dungeons were quite a few, but they were all equal in pace and nowhere near short. The bossfights were nothing special but that didn't gave the game a overall bad look.
but still.. the final boss was a bit disapointing...

Remember how I was saying windwaker had great music? Well throw that away cuz Majora's mask has THE BEST music.
I was blown away when I realised that each 4 areas had the same repeating melody, that feel so different, I still remember how mysterious great bay coast felt and the melody gave it such a beach ""lonely"" feel with a bit of sea salt on it(no pun intended)

The game also has the best sidequests in the series(of what I played)




  2: Ocarina of Time 

LEGENDARY GAME THAT'S ALL FOLKS

 



1: Twilight Princess

Playing OoT before this added alot to the the experience of Twilight Princess, it's almost as... Nostalgia...(even tho I played both of these this year for the first time)
What I am trying to say is that while I was playing TP I got OoT Nostalgia? Because they were similar in many ways.

I also fucking loved all the dungeons they all felt so ""rich"" I don't mind the linearity at all, in-fact, goron mines is probably my most liked dungeon, maybe because I like walking on walls.

There was one thing that I didn't like, and that is being able to turn into wolf, I know alot of people like it and its what makes TP stands out from other Zelda games, but I just like having gadgets all over me and going through the dungeons and puzzles like a tank.

Some of the bossfights felt a bit lazy like the pirana plant or whatever, but most of them were great like that dragon fight and that epic finale

Twilight Princess also has the best Zelda, at least in my opinion I just like her personality alot, also I like her clothes if not as much as yoga pants

One thing I loved most about TP is that it's long as fuck and I am so glad it is.

The ending! I loved the ending, that epic fight with ganon to midna cured of her cursed. it felt all in all a satisfying fulfilling and memorable rich experience that you will never forget.


PS: I played 2 other Zelda games but I didn't wanted to rank something that I didn't complete to the very end, anyway here's the order in which I played these games(including the ones I quit) starting from 2020 March 7 with ocarina of time>majoras mask>windwaker>a link to the past(ragequit)twilight princess>Phantom hourglass>skyward sword

It always has me thinking that same question, but another come pops in my head too. Why does no one complain about the yearly resets or change up of professional sports?

One might say that they’re tired of spending money each year for a new game. To watch your favorite teams games, you most likely will have to pay some sort of bill to watch it, whether that be your phone bill, wifi, cable, etc, so I would personally say that it is similar and more expensive too.

432,"Should mobile gaming get a Super Smash Bros-type game? I feel like mobile gaming should have a game where multiple characters from multiple mobile app franchises duke it out in a Smash like fighting game.  For starters, this would give each character's franchises more representation and more attention.  Many people love mobile games as much as console games, so having a fighting game app that features multiple mobile franchises wouldn't be that crazy.  There are many franchises that could get reps in this game like Puzzles & Dragons, Cookie Run, Summoner's War, Candy Crush, Bloons, Best Fiends, etc.

I was thinking that this game would be sprite based instead of 3D models to give more leeway to a phone's storage space.  Also, if gacha mechanics have to be involved, it would probably have to take the Fire Emblem Heroes route where all characters can be 5-star, but some will start at 3 or 4 star.  It would still have Smash mechanics like specials, title, aerials, etc. It could also be played offline and may be have some single player content and an online mode where you can duke it out with your favorite characters.

Speaking of Fire Emblem Heroes, games like it would have a chance to be in this mobile fighting game because it's main franchise is a video game.  However the rep, the stage and the music have to come strictly from that game.  This ruleset means that *all* anime games are off the table since they come from franchises that start as anime/manga.

So overall what do you think, should we have a mobile version of Smash Bros where all of our favorite mobile game franchises can be in one so we can duke it out (FYI, its not from Smash Bros, it's Smash Bros-like)",1

Maybe it's been all of the lockdowns and lack of physical connection with people this year, but I've never really been the competitive multiplayer type.  I usually just play what's fun, the most competitive I've been is raiding in WoW, but even then it was PvE stuff.


I've really found a love for competitive PvP games this year, most notably tactical shooters (CSGO, Valorant, and Overwatch mostly), but I got a small group of friends together, and over the past 6 months we've had an absolute blast learning, competing, and busting each other's balls.  Sometimes things get pretty heated, but the experience has been like no other gaming experience I've ever had.


I've had a lot of medical issues this year that have left me with chronic pain, and I've found that focusing in these competitive environments really helps block that pain out.  I guess if I had to look on the bright side of 2020, this is it.",1

Like small indie games like Hades and such are simple(er) video game graphics not incredibly realistic graphics with a ton of shit going on in the background, foreground, and midground just making game files a bijillion gigabytes and requiring insane processing to not bug the fuck out.

Spiderman for example. Looks amazing and is an amazing game yes but holy fuck the absolute bitching and moaning after not getting the realistic puddles like in the original trailer like come the fuck on.

Or Anthem that looks fucking amazing but utterly unplayable.

Something needs to change...

Edit1: just to add I also am welcome to a discussion on this rant so please feel free to agree or disagree I want to hear other people's side of this because I for one care less about graphics if the entire rest of the game is amazing. Like you can't say going back to play old great games is less fun because of the graphics.

494,"Jump from one competitive game to another when I peak, how to break an endless cycle. This  post is just over a decade in the making. I do not have any real  expectations for what kind of responses, if any, that I will get. I am  not even sure what I am looking for by making this post, but I know that  it is time to get all this written down in front of me and really look  at it.

I’m 25 now, and I’m getting  into my all too cycle of dumping my previous competitive game and  looking for the next one. I’m reaching out on here because I have to  imagine my story is a very common one – if maybe one that those who have  gone through don’t talk about much. I’ve always been a *good* player, but never a *great*  player at all the competitive games I’ve picked up and dumped over the  years. Like clockwork I will get to a point in a competitive game where I  feel that I’ve met my ceiling for the time I’m willing to invest.  There’s no sadness or anger about being “stuck” or anything like that,  just a realistic understanding I’ve done really well, but to crack that next tier I would need to put in more time than I will allow myself. But  for whatever reason, maybe the disappearance of progress and stagnation  setting in I simply leave the games never to come back. Again, it’s not  a rage quit sort of abandonment, but more apathetic and simply start  playing less and then not at all. I’ve done that since 2010 with ALL the  following games… Also, if anyone is below my rankings in these games  please do not interpret any of this as a humble brag. If this in any way  comes across like that, I have genuinely failed to convey my intentions  in this post, also I have hundreds of hours in all of these games, and  the ranks were my peaks where I stopped playing, I played 70% of my  games below those peaks.

* Star Craft 2 – Diamond Zerg
* COD Advanced Warfare – Grand Master
* League of legends – Diamond Jungle
* Overwatch –  Diamond 3400 soldier/ashe/anna
* Team fight Tactics – Diamond
* WoW – Sub Rogue 3v3 2k (Thug Cleave)
* MTGA Standard & Historic – Mythic (RB Sac, Sultai Mid-range)

I  have tried to get out of competitive games, because I always feel  drained and grey after moving from one to the next, but I have not been  able to kick it. I even played through Fable the Lost Chapters again  recently to get that kick of nostalgia, and while it was great, I fond  myself wanting that next competitive game experience. I tried to play  Skyrim again and immerse myself in the massive mod community, but again,  I was left wanting. I even tried God of War which I had greatly enjoyed  watching friends play - but any time I work through a single player  game I always find that I would rather read that story in a book then  play it out. Then there is the classic cycle of questioning whether my  last few hundred hours into a game were a waste, which I’m usually able  to rationalize away by saying that I enjoyed my time so no it wasn’t a  waste, and since it didn’t de-rail my academic or personal progress,  there wasn’t a massive opportunity cost squandered.

I  have tried to quit gaming entirely, not that I’m saying it’s a bad  thing to play games this isn’t that sort of post, but just that for me  and some others I’m sure it has this weird cycle of climbing, getting  reasonably high, and then moving on. I’ve gotten to the peak “non-pro”  level in a few games like when COD Advanced Warfare released there  ranking system and I hit grand master but that’s just because I was a  senior in high school with basically no classes left and infinite time.  And Mythic in Magic the Gathering Arena is I got playing a deck (RB  sacrifice) that either wins or loses games much more quickly than others  so I could fit more games into the same window a player with a  different deck would be able to.

I  made this account and this post because this morning I woke up and  started thinking about downloading DOTA, and began watching Day \[9\]’s  series with Purge where he learns to play the game, before I stopped  myself and thought “do I want to just do this all over again?”

I  really wish I knew what I was looking for in terms of a response to  this post, but I don’t. I Just needed to get this all off my chest.

TLDR: Get to top 3-10% in competitive games, dump them and move on. Feels empty.",1

545,"CDProjektRed should learn from BioWare Today we will be talking about how BioWare foreshadowed the downfall of cd:

BioWare has a history of rich RPG Games from knights of the old republic to dragon age, bio ware is without a doubt the most experienced company when it comes to RPG masterpieces and it is seldom that the company ever letted us down. Now why did BioWare foreshadow the downfall of cyberpunks disgraceful launch ? It is because of ego, throughout the years bio ware has been producing dozens of high quality cutting edge games that provided us with hours upon hours of quality enjoyment and quality pleasure, in this time, when BioWare was at its prime, BioWares reputation has sky rocketed but when reputation increases, so does ego. When BioWare was at the top of the game, it caught the eyes of many buyers, like EA, BioWare at this point of its life was prideful, Honorable and well respected in the community resulting it to breed something that I would like to call ""Gaming Ego"", it is when a game company reaches its peak that the conoanies ego starts to grow larger and large thus causing them to lose themselves to the persuading evil that the media has to offer such as Fame, Wealth, And contracts, at this time BioWare was unaware of its ego, thus causing them to blindly make a deal with the devil that is EA, thus making them, BioWare, the once renowned king of gaming, a slave to coperate mediocrity. This downfall of Buoware foreshadowed the downfall of CDPROJEKTRED because of how similar the situation is as of right now. CdProjektRed made a successful game and they letted the media plaque their once conscious minds with Money, Hype and coperate mediocrity, causing CD to focus more on the money than the actual game itself, that is why they decided to hire Keanu Reeves, a rather mediocre actor and spend thousands on advertisement instead of the game itself. And that’s why I think BioWare foreshadowed the downfall of CD. Lemme know what u guts think",1

I've got $60 spare to buy myself a present this year, and I've narrowed it down to these two. I haven't really seen much gameplay from either since I like to keep games fresh when I play them, which is why I'm asking here.  


I could see myself theoretically liking cyberpunk more, because I really like dystopian sci-fis, but I read it was a big disappointment. I wasn't a part of the hype train tho, so maybe I could enjoy it? I also super like customization and world building, which cyberpunk seems to have advertised.  


The other choice, RDR2 is probably the safer bet, considering its reviews. I do like westerns, maybe a little less than sci-fis, but being a cowboy/renegade bandit sounds fun for games.   


Tl;Dr: What are some things to consider when picking between these two games for someone who hasn't seen gameplay of either?",1

It seemed to do quite well on itch (better than I expected!) so I thought I should post it here too. The project started out of a drive to finish and release a project no matter what hurdles came in my way, this was my ""Trial by Fire"".

Mesonis is a game inspired by Risk, except it takes place in space and you get to take part in the battles to control the outcome.

There are two ship variants, and proc gen maps for unlimited playthroughs.

 ✨Procgen starmaps to wage galactic-scale war

🚀Control a pilot, control the outcome

💻: Supports PC, controller and mobile (just about)

589,"An analogy for Cyberpunk 2077 and those out of the loop. Imagine yourself seeing an ad on TV for an amazing Prime Rib meal with 14 sides, more food than you can possibly eat in one sitting. You have been dreaming about this amazing meal all week when finally it's Friday evening and you go out to sit down and enjoy it. You get to the restaurant, order it and eagerly await your feast.

However, when it arrives instead of seeing a prime rib, its instead an undercooked t-bone served with 2 sides, not the 14 you saw.

Unimpressed you call the manager over, point at your steak and say ""What is this? It's not finished!"" 

The manager apologizes and says he will be back with a properly cooked t-bone. Except he's bringing more of the same, just cooked this time, that steak isn't going to transform into the prime rib, they aren't going to also cook the remaining 12 side dishes they advertised.

So now your torn, because at the end of the day you came in damn hungry, so you eat around the undercooked meat, you eat your 2 sides. I mean a T-bone steak still isn't a BAD steak, but certainly not the prime rib you ordered. 

And thats how it feels to be a Cyberpunk 2077 player.

Now we could obviously call it the Xbox Series X but that is quite a mouthful. So to shorten it there are some choices. 
1) Right now you could just call it the Xbox but nobody would know which Xbox you were talking about and they have already have The Xbox. So I’m not sure it’s the best name for it. 
2) You can’t really call it the X in order to shorten it because there is the Xbox Series X and the Xbox One X and you would constantly have to specify which X you had. So I would submit that calling the Xbox Series X just the X is off the table. 
3) Finally there is the Series. (IMHO the best option) it’s the only part of the 3 part name that is Specific to this console generation. I think it has a nice ring to it and sounds a bit classy. It’s much shorter and not as abrasive as the 5 syllable Xbox Series X name. 

This is just a discussion. You can call your console Larry for all I care. I realize there is the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S but as they are the same generation console and will get the same games the Series name could go for both. Maybe not.

So I was thinking of doing that (might skip over Phantom Pain as it is probably the longest of the series and I've already beaten it anyway).

I was also thinking of playing in release order. I think it would make the transitions between them easier or at least visually look more cohesive (going from Metal Gear 2 to Metal Gear Solid might be easier then going from Ground Zeroes to Metal Gear).

702,"New Kid on the Block : FINAL EARTH (War style MMORPG)  Hey fellow gamers!

This post is about an interesting new game (well, refurnished old game, nevertheless), I had some pretty fun time playing it, and hope you do too! The name of the game is Final Earth, and I can provide a link if anyone requests in the comments. The summary is detailed as below:

1. All players are divided into axis or allies. The main objective as the Allies or Axis is to defeat the opposing team by taking over or destroying all critical enemy countries. Your team and their large forces will assist you aiding you during your battle with the enemy!
2. You can rank up from Private to President, unlocking troops, perks, powers and aid in the victory of your side.
3. Latest weapon tech, building factories and a plethora of other features have been introduced to resemble real-time warfare.
4. 'Points' gained can be carried over, but all ranks are reset once a war ends (one side emerges victorious \~ 30-40 days). While long-time players remain happy about their points, you gamers can start playing and help/fight just as much as anyone else.

There's in-game chat as well as a lively discord community, with some awesome people.

PS. The devs/mods are some amazing dudes (close friends), who work a lot to make this game fun and playable. I'm trying my best to spread the word about this game :)

Have Fun! Stay Safe!

708,"Cyberpunk 2077 is not a Good Game This statement is probably going to trigger a lot of people, but I feel the necessity to shout it out loud.

Cyberpunk 2077 is not a good game. It has no exceptional elements, excluding the story. And that doesn't save it. I am going to analyze in depth most of it's mechanics and systems, so please read until the end

1) Graphics. Now I know there's a lot if factors to consider here, but overall, Cyberpunk 2077 is an outdated looking game. No graphical elements are a standout, and the graphics look 2017 at best. There are countless other games, that not only look better, but are also older. Examples (Red dead redemption 2, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, metro exodus, etc). All games mentioned here are multi platform, and everything from lighting, character models and weather effects look way better. Not to mention exclusives like death stranding, gears 5 or God of war.

2) Gunplay. For a game where you spend a lot of time shooting people, the Gunplay isn't necessary great. I know it's not ""a FPS"" but still that is no excuse. Most of the guns felt like total water pistols and overall the shooting felt wrong.

3) melee combat: not much to say on this. The melee combat in this game is completely atrocious, so much so that even goddamned OBLIVION had a better combat system. A game that came out 14 YEARS AGO.

4) stealth and hacking: now the stealth is not that bad, considering this is no stealth game, but it still can't hold a candle to games like splinter cell, assassin's creed or Hitman. The hacking is far less varied than it was advertised, and it's simply no fun at all.

5) player choice: on the first playthrough, the choices seem critical, but after playing the game multiple times, you see thaf they are only an illusion. Nothing matters. NOT EVEN THE LIFEPATH. The only choice that affects the story is only in the god damn ending. Until then, nothing you do matters. You will get there regardless. In the exact same position. Considering how much emphasis was put on this during the marketing campaign, I expected something of Fallout level, buf we didn't even get a Witcher 3 level of choice. THE MAIN STOTY IS COMPLETELY LINEAR and everything CDPR told us was a LIE

6) RPG elements. Again. The game was marketed as ""be who you wanna be"" but in the final product that is not at all present. No matter what, V is a fixed character. You cannot be a greedy corp, or a no-bs nomad. You simply follow the story, without having a say in WHO YOU ARE. Even the Witcher 3 gqve us more options, when Geralt was a pre established character. Gerald's choices truly affected the world around him  but that is simply not in Cyberpunk. AgIn the illusion of choice is too damn obvious.

7) physics: no point in going over this. They are simply nonexistent

8) AI: here too. The Ai is soo bad, that it's practically nonexistent. The wnemies are dumb as trees and the npc act random as hell.

9) The driving: this is no racing game, but at oeast it should have decent driving. While it's not bad, games as opd as GTA 4 had better driving. A game that came out 12 years ago.

Redeeming qualities: storytelling, side quests and characters

As a end note, Cyberpunk 2077 is not a bad game, but it's qlso not a good game. For something with an estimated budget of 300 millions, and 7 years development time, the game is a catastrophe.

No point in denying it, just out of respect for CDPR. Lying to yourself that the games is good won't actually make it good.

I enjoyed this game, and I can say it's an enjoyable experience, but so are almost all games I have played trough the years.

I am a huge nerd when it comes to Input Lag in FPS, so when I received my PS5 and XbX i was initially disappointed at the  input lag i experienced. PS5 was the worst IMO weather it was my Scuf or my DualSense they both felt bad.   


I did some research and it looks like the median input lag for DS4s were \~2.5-3.5ms. The new DualSense was 7.8ms!!! When you are playing at 120fps that is noticeable!  

I have a 65in LG CX per rtings.com 4k @ 120hz should net me about 5.4ms not including lag from Bluetooth controllers. With the Dualsense the combined lag was 13.2...that's enough to really through off recoil control in games like  Apex, COD, etc.

&#x200B;

**The fix is to overclock the controller by forcing Wired Mode.** But for someone on a couch you need to go buy a long cable! Its like $10 on amazon... go do yourself the favor and do it!  


* Buy a 10ft Usb A-USB type-C. 
* Force Wired mode
   * \+0.5 k/D, +25 INT, +25 STR, -10 Stress 

&#x200B;

*This forces the controller for both XbX and PS5 to overclock and will net you 1ms latency.*",1

This has gone too far, I'm not the one who buys those games, but we all pay the price of this thanks to people who don't know any better.

Latest example is Back 4 Blood, but there are many other games too.

$60 Game Gets you:

Left 4 Dead + Card system and prettier graphics (You can get L4D for $5 on Steam most of the time)  
$60 By The Way!

DLC Characters with new abilities  
DLC Story  
DLC Acts  
DLC Mutation  
DLC Mutation Abilities  
And probably DLC Cards too, not confirmed, the rest are tho.

Now read this carefully so you can understand the situation better.  
Let's say I'm poor right, but I can afford the game a year from now, I buy the game and playerbase dies 2 weeks after, now probably the ""DLC STORY"" will be so if someone has the DLC, you can join them, but what if I have no friends to play with, and the playerbase is dead so I am unable to play the DLC Story & Acts?, assuming that's how it will be implemented.

For a $60 game, I would even draw the line on cosmetic skins sometimes, but maybe I can let them get away with skins as it's somewhat of a co-op game.

740,"I'm tired of not completing games but I dont know how to keep pushing through them. Hi all,

I'll start by saying that I love video games, I still inevitably play something every day and get enjoyment out of it. However, I've noticed my backlog of games to complete is just ridiculous at this point. I've noticed that when I start a game, I get very involved figuring out the mechanics, unlocking new abilities, etc etc and I love figuring these things out and learning how the game works. What I've noticed with myself however, is ill get a decent chunk in, have the majority of abilities and things unlocked and then its like a switch goes off and I become bored with it. This has happened with so much, God of War, FF7R, RDR2, Witcher 3, Darkest Dungeon, and so many more. For example, most recently I've been playing the Witcher 3. I did practically everything you can do in White Orchard before moving on,  then got a really big chunk of the Novigrad stuff done, then went on to Skellige. And literally as soon as I was done with the cutscenes and dialougue, I was bored. I had no more desire to be Geralt, before I loved doing the oils and decoctions and whatnot before a difficult fight coming up but now that all seems like busy work. This is the general feeling I get with the majority of games, it just feels like meh. The things I liked, I no longer care for, and I'm getting tired of it.

Do any of you experience something similar to this? If so, do you just keep slogging through until you're done? How do you keep feeling like the game is fresh and fun when nothing fresh or fun has happened since you started? I absolutely want to see how Witcher 3 ends and what all happens but I dont feel like making it happen. I wanna see Kratos bash in the rest of the gods heads, I wanna see Avalanche escape from Midgar in really pretty graphics, but I just can't find the drive.",1

788,"""Всего и побольше"". Рассуждения о Cyberpunk 2077. (rus. version) И так, под конец года в игровой индустрии произошёл один из крупнейших провалов, не только за 2020 год, но и за всю историю её существования. Игра, о которой последние два года в игрожуре не говорил только ленивый. Игра которая должна была стать хитом. Игра которую ждали все любители РПГ и интерактивного кино. Игра, которая должна была положить конец многолетней борьбе озабоченных любителей рисованных эльфиек и борцов за права трансгендеров. Игра которая..... в общем Cyberpunk 2077, рыцарь печального образа, сэр Распиареный и Неоправдавший, провалился. И событие это было с одной стороны совершенно неожиданным, а с другой вполне ожидаемым. Инь и Янь Лао Цзы. Единство и борьба противоположностей Гегеля. Нерождёное дитя сумрачного польского гения.  
 А ведь мог бы выйти и шедевр. Тем более, что поляки уже показали, что мрачное киберпансковское будущее победившего либертарианства это их конёк. Все последние крупные игры про кибер панк родом из Польши - Ruiner, Observer, Ghosatrunner (последняя пополам с датчанами, но всё же).  
 Не секрет, что игросторой сейчас переживает не лучшие времена. Уже второй год рынок наполняет череда откровенной халтуры от маститых разработчиков. Fallout 76, Anthem, Death Strending, Warcraft 3 Reforged, Street Fighter 5. Примеров много. Да и кризис начался отнюдь не в 2019м, а постепенно вызревал последние лет пять. Просто в 2019м году этот перезревший гнойник из жадности, косности и творческой импотенции вскрылся и начал заливать своим содержимым всё вокруг.   
 Симптомы кризиса были различными. Одни игры были сырыми недоделками, больше похожими на преальфу. Других сгубила монетизация и ""авторское видение"" разработчиков. Однако то, что случилось с детищем CD Projekt red, можно назвать беспрецендентным. Такой халтуры от компании - разработчика культового Ведьмака 3 ожидать было трудно. Уж больно резко произошло ""падение"". Bethesda, BioWare, Blizzard, EA, Кодзима и другие, деградировали медленно и их падение свершилось не за один год. Поляки же ушли в крутое пике всего за один проект.   
 Как это случилось? Хороший вопрос. Автор не владеет какой либо внутренней информацией студии CD Projekt red (далее все названия пойдут в русской транскрипции) либо её партнеров и все его рассуждения построены сугубо на том материале, который легко найти в русскоязычном сегменте интернета - рекламных роликах, записях игрового процесса и новостях русскоязычных игровых каналов.  
 Но обо всем по порядку и по пунктам.   
 1. Сам сюжет в игре не плохой, хотя и достаточно линейный (по крайней мере в начале). Атмосфера прогнившего, засраного и мрачного во всех смыслах будущего присутствует. Тут штатные писатели и художники-оформители сиди проджект ред молодцы. Не посрамили славу польской литературы. Так что Сенкевич, Лем и Гомбрович могут спать спокойно.

2. Техническое исполнение ужасно. Оно отвратительно во всех аспектах - код, оптимизация, игровая механика.  
 И вот тут встаёт вопрос, а чем разработчики занимались все эти годы? О начале разработки киберпанка было объявлено в 2012м году. Биоваре слепила Анзем за два года (с даты анонса). Глюки и баги в артхаусе от Кодзимы отловили за три. Ясновельможные паны же не совладали с заявленной задачей за целых восемь лет. Уверен, что работа над игрой началась ещё до своего анонса, так что так или иначе работали над ней лет девять или десять.  
 Если посмотреть все прежние обещания разрабов и новости последних месяцев, то становится яяно чем же они занимались - пытались впихнуть в свою игру невпихуемое. Прямо как Министерство образования Российской Федерации, чья политика строится по принципу ""навалить всего и побольше"".  
 Игрокам обещали огромный и живой мир, нелинейное прохождение (вплоть до того что сюжет можно пройти не выполняя сюжетных заданий), разные игровые классы, бег по стенам, поездки на метро, хорошую боёвку, настраиваемые по своему вкусу машины, ТРИПЛ ААА ГРАФОН и оптимизацию для всех игровых платформ, кроме свича и смартфонов. Как говориться ""Вераськыкуз ымысьтыз вӧй кисьтэ"" (""говорит как масло льёт"").  
 А теперь снова пункты и снова с номерами.

1. Полной нелинейности от создателей Ведьмака 2 и Ведьмака 3 ждать не стоило. Да и нет её ни где. ""Нелинейное прохождение"" это один из великих мифов игростроя. Что бы вы ни делали, даже в арканумах и фалаутах вы все равно пройдете по сюжету, посетив все заданные разработчиками места, и выполните финальное задание, выбрав в лучшем случае, одну из двух концовок. Но даже усечёная ""нелинейность"" второго фалаута - трудная штука. Её сложно прописывать и реализовывать технически. Общая литературность и проработанность повествования неизбежно пойдёт коту под хвост. А необходимые в современных графонистых играх манипуляции с болванчиками, моделями и скриптами усложнят код, наплодят кучу багов и раздуют и без того не маленький размер игры. Сиди проджект ред же в своих играх всегда, до этого, делала ставку на цельное, проработанное повествование.   
 2. Боёвка. С боёвкой у сидипроджектов всегда были проблемы. Кто играл в ведьмаков знает. Ну разве что на стрелковую часть можно было как то надеяться. Всё таки польские программисты на шутерах собаку съели (типа сарказм, но что то подсказывает что делать стрельбу проще чем ближний бой, особенно в играх от первого лица).

3. Метро, классы, бег по стенам, прокачка и прочее. Все знают что из игры вырезали кучу ранее обещанных вещей, а оставшиеся во многом не проработаны и требуют как минимум исправления. Тут повторяется история с автомобилем Делориан ДМС - 12. Тогда, в 70е Джон Делориан тоже наобещал с три короба. Мол в машине будут и супер пупер мощный движок без поршней и подушки безопасности, а потом оказалось, что всё это сложно, дорого и нафиг не надо. В общем машина вышла с необычным футуристическим кузовом, но стандартной дешёвой начинкой, да ещё и в отвратительнейшей сборке криворуких англичан из Ольстера.  
 Так же и с киберпанком. Потенциальным покупателям наобещали кучу проработанных механик и возможностей, а когда дошло до дела, оказалось, что конструктор собираться не хочет - детальки друг к другу не подходят. Судя по всему компания всё же до самого последнего момента пыталась увязать все заявленные компоненты игры во что то цельное, но не смогла. И на кануне выхода игры, всё, что не удалось пристроить в общую концепцию, пошло под нож.  
 4. Жадность. Тут я говорю о планах выпустить киберпанк на новом иксбоксе в момент релиза консоли. Аппетит приходит во время еды. И после Ведьмака 3 поляки почувствовали вкус денег. Больших денег. Видимо это и стало причиной заключения соглашения с майкрософт, о том, что киберпанк станет одной из основных игр на иксбокс, на старте нового поколения конслоей.

5. Оптимизация и графон. Тут у поляков тоже всё было не особо гладко. Ведьмак 3 технически был не плох. А вот второй..... напомню, что он был не оптимизирован и требовал от железа куда больше чем следовало бы. И для того что бы всё заработало надо было скачать и установить патч весом в 20 гб.

В целом ситуация видится следующей. Поляки около восьми лет честно пытаются собрать что то хорошее из своих обещаний. При этом лица, руководящие процессом и отвечающие за планирование, явно не понимают чего хотят. Не удивлюсь, если окажется, что у начальства не было никакого чёткого плана разработки и концепции игры, каждый элемент игры переделывался раз по десять, а общий объём работ превышал возможности коллектива. 

Далее, руководство компании заключает соглашение с майкрософт о том, что киберпанк 2077 выходит в наборах с новым иксбоксом на старте продаж последнего, что ставит перед сиди проджект ред чёткую дату окончания работ.

И вот наступает 2020 год. Скоро ноябрь, майкрософт требует уже готовую игру, да и в Варшаве понимают, что бесконечно затягивать разработку нельзя и пора начинать отбивать затраченные деньги, пока расходы не ушли в заоблачную высь. Но игра то не готова. Неготовы даже базовые элементы игровой механики, о чём говорит вырезание в последний момент классов и игровых элементов (типа бега по стенам). И вот, в последний момент из неё начинают выкидывать всё, что не удалось заставить так или иначе работать, а оставшееся сводить во едино и спешно адаптировать под заявленные игровые устройства. Но ""festina lente"" (""поспешай медленно""). Поспешная перестройка игры порождает кучу багов, что в свою очередь порождает кучу новой работы и как следствие срыв сроков сдачи и так несколько раз. Ну а в конце, поняв что уже всё, дальше отнекиваться нельзя и подсчитав, что имеющихся предзаказов и ожидаемых продаж на старте хватит, чтобы хотя бы окупить разработку поляки, перекрестясь, вываливают, то что есть на данный момент.   
 В итоге закономерный провал, который стал бы смертным приговором для многих компаний. Но сиди проджект ред пока что хранит авторитет создателей Ведьмака.  

Безусловно, авторитет этот весьма заслуженный. Только вот удар по нему нанесён серьезный и компания, ещё недавно гордо восседавшая на игровом Олимпе, наравне с другими небожителями, в одни миг оказалась на самом краю пропасти ведущей даже не в Аид, а в самый настоящей Тартар, где тьма, уныние, пост-рок и Anthem.

P. S. Единственное удивительное для всей этой истории, это то, что версии киберпанка для пс 4 и икс бокс ван, оказались самыми забаговаными. Ведь, казалось бы, адаптировать код игры под заранее известный набор железа проще, чем под весь пэкашный зоопарк.",1

https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddawkins/2020/12/20/meet-the-mysterious-former-billionaire-behind-the-video-game-disaster-cyberpunk-2077/amp/

Pertinent info: 
""Within the industry, CD Projekt Red was notorious for burning out its employees in the final months of production, known as “crunch.” Given the pressure to produce another blockbuster game, Kiciński understood that the only way to meet the unforgiving deadlines was to cut corners and fix the glitches after launch. Such flaws in the production pipeline would eventually become disastrous for Cyberpunk 2077, but Kiciński left that for others to solve. “Once the company got stable,” he says, “I felt confident I could leave.”

Over its protracted development period, Cyberpunk 2077 milked for every droplet of hype it could find. Its biggest pre-launch triumph was scoring Keanu Reeves as the game’s frontman. In the final months of development, despite delaying the release by several months, the pandemic provided a rare opportunity for success. With the entire slate of big-budget movies shelved in 2020, there couldn’t have been a better time to release a video game with such exceptional pedigree. 

Over the summer, analysts predicted that Cyberpunk 2077 could sell north of 25 million units in the first year, which, at around $60 per game, would result in a record revenue year for the company. (In 2015, the year Witcher 3 was released, CD Projekt rang up $213 million.)

But in the months before its release, much of the good will built around the game had evaporated. After several delays in Cyberpunk 2077’s launch—the date moved from April to September to November—before landing on December 10. CD Projekt Red reportedly intensified the crunch—including 6-day work weeks—to meet the final deadline.

To launch in time for holiday shopping this year, corners were cut, which lead to numerous bugs, including the incompatibility with older consoles and the infamous penis glitch, alongside a whole host of issues that could have been avoided. Several analysts told Forbes that the expectation was for CD Projekt Red to alternate releases of a new Cyberpunk and a Witcher game every two-and-a-half years, with revenue-generating downloadable content (extra playable stories priced around $20) sandwiched in between. With the extra time now needed to fix the problems with Cyberpunk 2077—and to avoid making the same mistake again with the next release—that calendar has likely been abandoned.""",1

864,"How did CDPR (and others) not see the backlash coming? This is mainly a question to people who have some experience with big-budget development and it reads as the title: what did they expect?

For contrast: I work in a very small R&D company and we don't have 9-figure euro deals. Usually when a project goes ass up, management and sales can work it out with the client.
How does this work for development of this level? Everybody knew that they would get torn to pieces if CP2077 wouldn't end up *very, very good*. How did the C-level execs not?
Did they just think it was going to be fine? That people would swallow this anyway? Same goes for other big publishers. The people who run studios are not oblivious idiots, they must realise that a broken product won't be received well and will cost the company (and themselves) in the long run, yet they push them out of the door. So how does this work? 
Thanks for your input!

Edit 2: I get the money now argument, but they must realise that you can only do this once, right? And I would think management would be equally concerned with the generation of revenue in the future (in the case of cdpr by using their reputation, other companies have other methods)?

Hello Gamers, what is up?

Happy Merry Christmas to all of you good boys and girls ( Giving cookies and cup of milk to you\* )

and for Santa deniers, happy winter i guess ( Giving full stock of coal\* )

Let's get to my point:

* Today i downloaded a masterpiece game called Starsiege Tribes considered one of the best FPS games on the PC of all time and it got high reviews on the internet and even IGN saying a lot of good things about it, well actually i can't get to see that good side of the game because it is too old for my windows 7...
* The things is, i downloaded the game for free officially from a website and i will give the link for who wants to try in DM because i can't provide links here in this sub, i installed the game properly on my Drive and booted it up, the game opens but in windowed mode and cornered in the top left of my screen, i try to press Alt+Enter but that doesn't work and i try to click on that maximize thing on the window on top the game goes fullscreen but bordered and still having very low resolution which is weird, i try to mess with the settings of the game using the keyboard keys to navigate to the panel or the tab that i want because i didn't mention that the mouse doesn't work on main menu but it works in the gameplay itself (shooting and looking around), i set my game on 1600x1200 which is my monitor's max resolution and i still get windowed view, i tried to use OpenGL rendered by the way...

It features a variety of vehicles that are all able to drive around a small map surface and ultimately smash into each other.

I remember vividly there was one vehicle called Behemoth which was basically just a large truck that was, as the name implies, very strong and destructive but really slow and heavy.

It has been announced today that MGM Holdings Inc. are considering selling its studio to other film studios in Hollywood for $5.5bn, including their entire film library from the James Bond movies to the Rocky Balboa movies. This is quite a groundbreaking development in the film industry given the historic age of MGM and its multitude of multi-million dollar properties so I felt it was worth discussing which rival movie studio will end up buying out MGM.

There are several options ranging from Disney to Universal Pictures to Sony to Paramount Pictures and even smaller studios than theres but personally I would love to see Warner Bros. end up buying out the studio given how well they produced Creed 2 and most of the movies made by MGM are similar in tone to other Warner Bros. franchises.",0
9,"Christmas movies that actually aren't Christmas movies? There is a difference between a Christmas movie and a movie that happens to take place at Christmas (time); completely or in part.

For example, I've seen *Mean Girls* described as a Christmas movie a few times:

https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/g13152053/funny-christmas-holiday-movies/ (#16)

Even though the Jingle Bells Rock scene is well known (and fun), I don't see how that would make *Mean Girls* a Christmas movie. It's not like the whole movie takes place during Christmas, or covers any topics/themes usually associated with Christmas or holiday season. And it wasn't released around Christmas time either.

To be fair, most people seem to realize that, though this angle is still discussed sometimes:

https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/11-best-incidental-christmas-movies-article-1.2905317

https://www.buzzfeed.com/tessafahey/christmas-movie-poll

Same with *Die Hard* ; that one is more commonly described as a Christmas movie, but I don't see how that would apply. It is simply an action movie that happens to take place on Christmas Eve. And it was released in July. Christmas simply served as a reason for John to travel to Los Angeles and visit his estranged wife (and children) during the holidays, thus starting the plot.

Plot (As far as I can remember)

It starts with this guy in a mansion, and some other people are fighting him, and he beats them up. It's then revealed that he is the owner of the mansion, and the people who were fighting are his employees who where training him (I think) 

The next scene I remember was the Mansion owner guy was running from someone (Dunno who or why) but he ends up in a Mall. to avoid getting caught, he dresses up as Santa Claus for the Mall. While he did get away, he lost his memories, and he thinks he Santa (I think) Soon an employee elf finds him, brings him back to the other elf employees, and he does what any Mall Santa does. (Side story with the elf employee who found him. He made a bet with the other elf employees on who would find Santa first, and when he comes back with him he says Santa, losers. Losers, Santa)

Next I can recall is that it then cuts to an orphanage who are being harassed by some group of people. When they try to drive away, the Mansion Guy (Santa) picks up the back of the truck, which impressing the owners of the orphanage and its kids. He then tries scaring the group inside, but there not fazed and leave anyway.

It looked like just another “bro” comedy judging by the trailers, so I could see why people would brush it off (me included).


But, I caught this film on Comedy Central or something about 10 years ago and couldn’t believe how hilarious it was. The comedic performances are on point; particularly by Ryan Reynolds and Anna Faris. And although a lot of the jokes are slapstick in nature, they’re extremely well executed. Oh, and it’s a Christmas movie!...I guess! It takes place during Christmas, it has carolers, and someone’s Christmas decorations gets burnt to a crisp. It’s holiday fun for the whole family.


But seriously, the movie does actually have a lot of heart despite how wacky it can get. The chemistry between Reynolds and Amy Smart is perfect and the story is very relatable, especially for anyone who had a huge crush on someone in high school that never came to be - whether you were best friends with them or not. I suggest you guys check this film out during the holiday season. Unfortunately, it’s not on any streaming platform so you’ll have to shell out a few bucks, but it’s worth it.

I mean, in Under Siege, his character had to get locked up for attacking an officer and he's only a cook. 

It's a stupid, generic action movie but I will say I loved Tommy Lee Jones in this. I've never seen Lee Jones be this over the top and comical, usually he plays brooding, grouchy roles but here he's hammy and acting crazy. I mean, his fight with Seagal is worth the ticket price. Lee Jones getting repeatedly cut had me in stitches. Oh, and Gary Busey was already crazy in this movie, one highlight is him in drag, looking like Denise Crosby (Taha Yar) from Star Trek. 

And Erika Eleniak (The OG Baywatch Chick)takes her clothes off.  Straight guys will love that. I was like, gross, put some clothes on!!!",0
59,"What is your favorite version of ""A Christmas Carol""? In case you were wondering how many there have been [here you go.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptations_of_A_Christmas_Carol#Film)

For serious versions it's hard to go against the George C Scott version. The casting is just perfect. George and David Warner make perfect Scrooge and Marley. 

I keep seeing the 2009 animated movie with Jim Carrey brought up. I hear it's good but I've never seen it.

It's been a while since i saw the original *Mickey's Christmas Carol.* Am i insane or did Scrooge get pulled into the bowls of hell at the end of the movie when he was confronted by the ghost of Christmas Future?

It's listed under Derivative Works on the Wikipedia article but I still love *Scrogged.* Just a wonderful job from Bill Murray. And honestly the plot still works today. Just update the technology and it's still the same movie. 

Last but certainly not least apparently there was a musical adaptation staring Colin Baker of Doctor Who fame. This sounds like it could either be amazing or a train wreck.",0

I'm wholly aware that some movies are objectively popular but there is definately a collection of films that seem to be highly popular on this platfrom regardless of how popular they are in the 'mainstream'. I like to *think* I know what makes movies popular here but I can't seem to articulate it.

Films like Bright, Tucker and Dale Vs Evil, Sharknado, John Wick, The Last Action Hero, Drive, Old Boy, Battle Angel Alita, Tropic Thunder all fall into different genres, but are absolutely loved here, can anyone attempt to explain why?",0
64,"When you need a pick-me-up: We Bought a Zoo! When I first saw the trailer for this flick, I automatically thought to myself that I'd never watch this movie. Then, lo and behold, flipping through channels with nothing on and stoned out of my mind, I land on Matt Damon quitting his job because he's just a good guy and he wants his newspaper to be profitable, even without him working there as a correspondent.

Then I'm watching Matt Damon speak with some school bureaucrat about how his kid makes devilish artwork and steals money from the school. Kid gets kicked out and I'm thinking that this movie doesn't have dick to do with zoos.

From that point forward, J.B. Smoove is the perfect realtor hungry for his first sale and then a few minutes later, enter Scarlet Johannson. When she did that movie with the horses some 35 years ago, I had no idea that she'd turn into such a dish.

Seriously, though, the movie was great and kind of sucks you in. Even that Elle Fanning actor was entertaining in this movie along with that Pat Fuckit guy who starred in the movie about groupies 35 years ago and hasn't done dick since. But it also had that guy from Best in Show in the movie (he died recently) and his characters are so goofy and spot on at the same time.

The story sucked me in as this old zoo was struggling during a state takeover and Matt Damon and his kids (along with Scarlet) are going to put it back together again. There's adversity, like the Best in Show guy as a zoo regulator with a battery powered tape measurer who's trying to shut them down, followed by rains (who wants to go to a zoo in the rain?). Matt Damon's boy kid in the show is a real fucker, but he changed before it was all said and done.

I'm glad the movie makers didn't fill in the movie with some comic book, time traveling crap and too much CGI. In addition, they didn't clutter it up with Matt and Scarlet getting it on when the little precocious girls walks in, and I was expecting a sex scene all along and it would have been totally inappropriate. But the movie makers even point out via Thomas Haden Church's character that Scarlet is a major league dish and the only reason to buy a zoo.

The movie almost made me cry at the end. It was kind of like Rudy meets a family with a dead mom and a zoo desperately trying to fail.",0

66,"Why John Cazale is my favorite actor. No one ever really seems to talk about Cazale. Maybe it was because his career was cut short or he only played supporting roles? I'm not sure. But to me, his career is astonishing. Only managing to star in five films before tragically passing away due to lung cancer in 1978, John Cazale has one of the best track records of any actor I've seen. It seems like every actor, no matter how good they are has that one film that people can make fun of. Not John. The films he acted in were The Godfather, The Conversation, The Godfather Part II, Dog Day Afternoon and The Deer Hunter as a posthumous release. All five films were nominated at the Academy Awards for Best Picture with The Godfather Parts I & II along with The Deer Hunter winning. He was paired with phenomenal actors such as Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Gene Hackman, Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep to name a few. He was a very subtle actor who would perform a lot with body language, making a nice contrast with actors such as De Niro and Pacino. Every single role he had, he played with such legitimacy and realism. He had a vibe and a way about him that I haven't managed to see in any actor since. My favorite role of his is probably Stan from The Conversation. It was to me, a very different role for him but he absoloutely owned it. With what time he had, Cazale delivered in my opinion, Oscar worthy performances across five masterpieces. May John Cazale's legacy live on and may he rest in peace. 

What do you think of John Cazale? What do you like most about him? I'd love to get a discussion going here!",0

Maybe the characters seem exaggerated but they're packing a lot of clear symbolism into a tight space. Just watching the co-existence of radical characters in impossible circumstances feels a sort of sympathetic socratic dialogue. You have people who are total opposites making big mistakes trying to live the best way they know how. Meanwhile the main character is just facing the prospect of trying to live at all. Consequently they change so quickly before it's too late on a timelines that's not their own to set.

It's paced quickly, packed with human moments and no wasted exposition. No wasted side plots. I can't believe how happy I am to see a movie about people making mistakes but then actually learning how to live with what's going on.

Man I was dreading that they'd drop the ball at some point into edgy full-on tragedy but they didn't. It did NOT have the perfect (yet inevitable) ending that I wanted. But what it did have caught me so off guard I cried immediately. I just think it's sad it maybe couldn't follow it's message all the way through, but it did a damn good job. It's so good. Really heartbreaking and punchy with really earnest characters and truly unbelievable performances from the whole cast. You know that saying not a tragedy but a triumph.

Also the soundtrack is awesome! Used well in the film and I knew I'd be queueing it it up when the movie finished.

Maybe a bit of a niche movie but I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who watched stuff like Thumbsucker back in the day.",0

the amount of expository dialogue is fucking ridiculous. did nobody tell him it was too much?! i know for a fact he knows better. 

by the time inversion happens, i just don't give enough of a shit about any of these characters to keep going. there has to be some sort of heart anchoring the audience to the characters and its just not in the script. was he just doing his own version of a bond movie where they hit the ground running and put a sci-fi twist on it that literally made no sense? because those scripts rely on the audience to already know bond's reputation, then the writers put little spins on that existing stereotype(in the more engaging recent installments like skyfall). 

early messaging in the movie ""JUST DON'T THINK ABOUT IT"" was not only way too on-the-nose, but clashed with later expository dialogue where characters explained more of the setting's rules. thats a *huge fucking no-no*. where were the people to review the script and tell him *holy shit, what are you doing?!*

So in the holiday spirit and as something of a follow-up to my [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/kgqamr/whats_the_movie_that_made_you_realize_movies_can/), let's all say one nice thing about a movie we don't love. I'll start.

Last Airbender is the movie that made me realize movies can be bad, but I'll say this: the production design, art direction, costumes etc., are all high quality and resemble the show. Unlike previous adaptations that don't even look like their source material (cough, dragon ball evolution), Last Airbender is unmistakably Avatar, at least in look.

I have a number of questions.

I am not a German speaker, but his approximation seems very, very rough, worse in fact than you get just reading the printed words.  Was that a severe failure in preparation?  Or is there some dialect of the language where the verb is pronounces like “SHYss”?  Or (my preferred explanation) is the director John McTiernan hinting that Gruber is not who he pretends to be?

And why does Karl not understand German?  And if he does not, why does Gruber, who knows him well, speak to him in German?  

Mostly, why is this exchange even in the movie?  Is it an artifact of some plot point that was otherwise left on the cutting-room floor?",0

91,"Need help finding a scary old Nickelodeon movie Apologies if this is not the right place to post this, but I have spent the last hour or so trying to find any sort of information about a movie I remember watching on Nickelodeon as a kid that scared me really badly. I'll do my best to share details here and see if anyone else remembers it and can help me track it down.

I believe the movie is about a young boy who befriends a troll-looking creature that visits him in his home. This creature presents himself as kind to the boy but is actually evil and is looking to (I believe) capture the boy, like he has done with many other children over the years. The boy draws a picture of the creature and shows it to his family, who at first think it is cute that he has an imaginary friend. But the boy insists that he is real, and the parents don't take it seriously at all. I believe the boy has a sibling, and the sibling begins to realize something is wrong. Sadly, I've forgotten most of the details of the plot from that point on, but I do remember that they eventually are able to get the creature to disappear. The movie ends with the kids discovering a large footprint or something like that, insinuating that the creature lived and was on its way to perhaps try and kidnap another child.

I only remember seeing this air once, but it may have been shown multiple times. The timeframe for the movie would have likely been between 1997 and 2002. It was not a very good movie, and I have a suspicion that it was a made-for-tv type deal.

Google searches are only turning up Cry Baby Lane and Don't Look Under the Bed as far as scary children's movies, but I know it isn't either one of those. The plot is far too different from Cry Baby Lane to be a misrememberance of it, and I didn't have Disney Channel growing up so it couldn't have been DLUtB.

* Dwayne Johnson (huge paychecks but known more for being a solid entertainer rather than a serious actor)
* Nicole Kidman (very recognizable, highly paid and celebrated, very much considered A-list even tho the average person probably can’t name or haven’t seen any recent projects)
* Bradley Cooper or Matthew McConaughey (C-list to commercial success to shit projects to surprisingly highly-regarded serious projects to A-list)

I dug really deep and found a ton of stuff, but a few titles managed to elude me. The biggest one is his 1992 doc *Cousin Bobby.* I've heard rumors it could be coming to home video/streaming soon, but it got taken off the Sundance Doc app/channel before I could watch it. I've also been unable to track down a copy of his more experimental 1988 doc *Haiti Dreams of Democracy*. Then there's a live-streamed Kenny Chesney concert (sponsored by American Express) he directed in 2012, *Line of Sight* (a pilot to a show that never got picked up starring David Morrissey), as well as a segment on the Tavis Smiley show (about hurricane Katrina, I believe) titled ""Been in the Storm Too Long.""

123,"ISO: 1960s/1970s vampire movie title I was a kid (80s) when I saw the movie on tv during the afternoon. I want to say it aired on ABC or USA though it’s possible it was on a public access station. The *only* reason I remember it & am looking for the title is due to the fact this movie grossed me out so much so due to a scene of blood & worms that looked exactly like the bowl of spaghetti. Never could eat pasta with red sauce after that especially not spaghetti. lol

Plot: no idea really other than it involved vampires, a beautiful woman in either a blue or a red dress (obviously the target of the vampire). I don’t recall if it was a generic vampire movie or a Dracula one but there was a scene with a carriage & black horses. At one point the woman is running through a garden with a (ruined?) tower.

Like I said above, the scene that I remember clearly is the scene of blood & worms that look like spaghetti & I want to say the horses & carriage scene was part of the same scene.

I was a kid when this was on tv & I think it’s possible that it was dubbed in English from Italy but that I’m not 100% sure. The 1960s & 1970s were pretty popular with vampire & werewolf movies & I’ve tried over the years to find it but no luck.

Anyone might have a title this could fit?",0

141,"""Welcome to the Dollhouse"" (1995) is a rarity: A Depressing Film about an outsider who's mistreated by almost everyone in her life and yet, I found myself laughing at her predicament. Dawn Weiner (Heather Matarazzo) has the worst luck. A young girl who's bullied by her classmates, her teachers and even her family. She can't catch a break. When she falls for the lead singer of her brother's band, she asks for advice from a girl who tells her to give up since she's a dog. Her parents mistreat and embarrass her and aren't shy of showing favoritism towards her kid sister whom Dawn detests. 

The one person who appears to like Dawn is Brandon (Brendan Sexton III), the bully who threatens to rape her yet as Dawn gets to know Brandon, she realizes he's a sensitive soul who doesn't understand most of the stuff he says. 

As I was watching Welcome to the Dollhouse, I wondered if Seth McFarlane based Meg Griffin from Family Guy on Dawn since the majority of the (dark) humor in Welcome to the Dollhouse comes from seeing Dawn be treated like scum. I kept gigging at how unfortunate Dawn's luck was yet I also got the sense she was her own worst enemy and Dawn's cluelessness made it difficult for one to be sorry for her. 

It's brilliant how Todd Solondz captures the growing pains of youth, I identified with Dawn to some degree and the way high school is depicted was true to life.

149,"Brian De Palma's ""The Bonfire of the Vanities"" turns 30 today, and it’s still a visually stunning piece of garbage. It seemed like yesterday that this would be one of the first films mentioned when people point to ambitious Hollywood failures. Then again, there is a point where a failed black comedy based on a beloved book hits its fifteen minutes of notoriety. Regardless, this movie is still pretty terrible.

But since this is a De Palma film with a massive budget, it also means we get some impressive cinematography. There are single take shots galore, as well as various perspective shots and split screens. *The Bonfire of the Vanities* is also known for a specific shot where a plane is flying into an airport behind a blood red sunset; what makes this shot so special was that there was a 10-minute window to film it and it only came once every few centuries or something. It's as beautiful as you'd expect, even though it's completely wasted in this garbage. In fact, I'd argue the stunning visuals are completely irrelevant to the film's quality because it doesn't match up all that well.

But why do I--along with plenty of people--think it's garbage? How could such a beloved book be turned into such a movie worth being labelled as a true debacle? There are plenty of reasons, actually, as well as to why it might be De Palma's worst film (this coming from a *Mission to Mars* survivor--ugh).

- The screenplay is heavy handed beyond belief. Despite being envisioned and billed as a dark comedy, the constant hammering of the movie's themes don't have satirical bite but are instead woefully depressing to watch. From mere social commentary about depressingly grim political problems of the city (such that feel pretty reductive, in that it seems to be a simplistic ""black v white"" scenario given the lack of context from the book) to references about art and opera, the jokes collapse upon themselves before impacting thanks to being too obvious. Not to mention the inclusion of broad slapstick, courtesy of De Palma trying to satisfy commercial audiences.

- De Palma has a lot of talent, but I can't begin to wonder how he thought taking this on was a good idea. His best work lies in his slow, atmospheric, voyeuristic Hitchcock-style thrillers, and none of those terms help this film at all. Especially slow. This movie wouldn't feel so painful if it also didn't feel twice as long as it did.

- Tom Hanks (I can see why this could have ended his career when it came out--he really takes a lot of the film's flaws with him) is too much of a nice guy and too familiar of a presence to fit the role of Sherman McCoy.

- Melanie Griffith overdoses her role as the dim trophy wife.

- What and why is Bruce Willis in this? (He's a drunkard, eh? What's it to you?) What is this narrative framing device he uses when he's barely in the movie? (I *know* why, but the execution feels too wrong.)

- The orchestra soundtrack is wrong on every level for this. Especially as a comedy.

Bottom line: it's got all the effect of a heavy sermon lecture with none of the charm or grace to make it worthwhile in even the slightest. It’s the worst kind of bad: it's insufferably agonizing. (Aside from maybe the scene where Hanks has a gun, where the film starts to slide so much into excess that it borders on self-parody.) Avoid it like the plague.",0

153,"I've really enjoyed Downhill despite the 4.8 IMDB rating. Do you often ""disagree"" with rating averages? How should I choose what to watch? Edit: Why the downvotes?

The main criterion I use when deciding what to watch is the rating average but I'm increasingly noticing that it's not a good predictor of how I will like the movie or series.

I started watching Broadchurch (85% on the site I use) and after one and a half episodes, not sure if I'll finish it, it's not bad, but not great either. Yesterday I started watching Queen's Gambit (90%), but got bored and stopped in half of the first episode. Then, for some reason I picked Downhill despite the 44% average - thought I'm gonna break the pattern of only watching 70+% stuff - and genuinely enjoyed it! I liked the unusual humour. Maybe it was the low expectations. Something about it reminded me of Woody Allen movies which I always enjoy.

Some other movies where I disagree with the rating:

- Inception (89%) - boring, I would give it 50%
- Avatar (82%) - boring, 50%
- The Man from Earth (81%) - very boring, 40%
- Crank (72%) - hilarious and engaging all the time, 90%
- Gypsy (71%) - deserves 85%

I have a few hours now to download some stuff before my internet goes away; BUT, I'll be able to charge my laptop on the bus! That means I can basically spend every hour watching or reading content that I've already downloaded.

Here is my itinerary:

1. I have to leave in an hour or two to get to the bus station, where I will wait until 12 hours from now to take the first bus.
2. The first bus ride will be overnight and take 9 hours, then I will have to wait another 4 hours to take my connecting bus
3. The second bus is another 8 hour trip–then I get to my hotel!

Altogether it's around 16-18 hours of travel/waiting. Some of that time will be spend sleeping but the rest is free for culture! 

Now that said, I was thinking the Lord of the Rings Trilogy, since I haven't seen it before, but I'm not really keen on fantasy movies. I just hear it's really good and the movies are like 3 hours each!

156,"Any Movies With Zack Galifainakis In A Serious Role? I recently watched Birdman for the first time (btw it was awesome I had been sitting on it for a while but glad I finally watched it) but I noticed Zach played a fairly serious role for that one. Sure he was a bit comedic at times but majority of his character was held under the serious blanket.

So I’m wondering if there are any other movies where he plays a serious role. Preferably good movies but I’m open to even meh movies. I’ve always liked it when comedic actors take a couple times to do roles different than what they usually do (Like Sandler in Uncut Gems) and Zach has always been a funny guy in my eyes so I’d just like to see more of his work giving more dramatic and serious stuff rather than his usual comedy.",0
157,"Proving once and for all that Die Hard (1988) is a legit Christmas movie with the one argument you haven't yet heard Die Hard is a Christmas movie, and I'll prove it. After all, this is important stuff, and it's time we settle this once and for all. :)  

To the people who say it's just a movie that happens to take place at Christmas, you are wrong.  The entire plot is central to it being Christmas.  

First, John wouldn't have made the trip from New York to LA (to have a few laughs) if he wasn't invited to the Christmas party. It needed to be Christmas to even start the movie. 

And second, and most importantly, the bad guys needed the building mostly empty so they could easily take control and have a few hostages in order to give them time to break into the vault and keep the ruse up that it was more than just a heist.  It had to be Christmas in order for them to do what they wanted. 

We could stop here. 

But to stretch my argument further to prove to the people who still say a Christmas movie must be _about_ Christmas... I'll add, it is that as well, at least in metaphor.  Check it out. 

Hans and his bad guy Pals are the Romans. That makes John, of course, Jesus.  He went through physical and mental torture, and sacrificed his own body (remember the iconic bloody scene at the end?  ""Hi honey."").

Sergeant Al Powell was John's Angel. In both gospels Luke and Matthew Jesus had angels ministered to him. And in the movie Al is the person reminding John that he should ""know when to pray"". (The only reference to praying in the whole movie). He even guides John through the negative talk about his wife and assures him that he'll make it out alive, leaving John with the thought: ""I guess that's up to the man upstairs"".

The FBI guys (Johnson and Johnson) are the false prophets and saviors.  There are several references to false prophets in the Bible but here's one from Mark: ""For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders, to lead astray..."".  They claimed to know how to handle this and convinced the local police to use choppers even though they knew the ""breakage"" on hostage deaths were up to 25%, and they were okay with that. 

And what about Ellis, the loud mouth cocaine guy from the beginning of the movie who works with ""the romans"" to give up (betray) John?  Well that's Judas of course.

162,"[Serious] When would a standalone installment in a major franchise be a good or bad thing? Apart from *James Bond*, which until the Daniel Craig era, largely *was* self-contained, apart from the same actor each era - Timothy Dalton, Roger Moore etc., when, in a major franchise like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, DC Extended Universe, Star Wars etc. would a standalone film be a *good* thing?

I'm not talking about sequels like *Mr. Bean's Holiday* or *Trolls World Tour - was that the one with Justin Timberlake's Can't Stand the Feeling in?*, *Toy Story 4* etc.?

Franchises are a good thing, as are standalone films; but here, the focus is on standalone movies within a franchise that aren't a sequel, but aren't a side story.

Anime tends to do this fairly well, as we've seen with the *Dragon Ball* movies, although they're non-canon to the anime, not that it has any bearing on quality of storylines, I just consider them a separate canon; and the multiple Pokemon and One Piece movies.

Are there any current franchises you feel could do with a standalone movie that can be appreciated on its own merit telling a self-contained story and is either a good jumping-on point or doesn't need the audience to know prior chronology of the franchise to understand?

**42. Rubber (2010)** 

Pretentious, boring, and just plain anticlimatic. It's about a rubber tire that can kill people with its mind but also follows a group of people observing it in the desert. It's meta in all the worst ways, super up its own ass, I thought there was a fun idea for a film but they fucked it up hard and the worst part is they knew it. Don't watch this at all.

**41. Alien Private Eye**

Alien Private Eye follows a man who is mentioned as an alien at the start and its hardly ever mentioned ever again. I watched this so long ago and can't remember shit apart from the fact that the 'alien' make up was simply elf ears on the private eye for the whole film. There's a dance battle or something but in reality its quite a boring film, dont waste your time.

**0/10**

****

**40. Birdemic**

This film has 2 funny moments. One where the mild mannered hero somehow secures a deal in a sleepy Floridian town worth 1 billion dollars and his date is not phased and the terrible CGI birds, which I'm sure you've seen. Rest of it is really boring, like not much happens except for most of the cast being murdered by murders of crows. It's sad because the female lead is really trying but the male lead could not give less of a shit. I don't care enough to look up their names but yeah, it was not that good.

**0.1/10**

**39. Manos the Hands of Fate**

This film is notorious because one of the cast members is tweaked out on crystal meth during the entire film, and I did not notice until a friend told me about it. It's ok, but again, boring. It's a horror film about a family who crash their car and they take shelter in Manos' residence, then some hellish shenanigans ensue. It wasn't worth it to be honest, a lot of these films at the bottom have funny concepts but half assed executions which is not what you want because there isn't anything entertaining created.

**1/10**

****

**38. Blood Street**

This is one of Leo Fong's Kung Fu films with a man named Cameron Mitchell, an old school Spaghetti Western actor who became an alcoholic and decided to do  whatever film script came across his desk as long as it came with a bottle of vodka. This is not Leo Fong's and Cameron Mitchell's best work, even though the story has twists and turns the general cohesive produced just doesn't have a lot to enjoy. The worst thing a film can be is boring and this one, despite the star power, is boring. This isn't Leo Fong's last entry in this list, however.

**1.5/10**

**37. Zoolander 2**

Not every film on this list had the budget of a shoebox and the level of effort of me in university. This one had a crazy budget and less effort than me in third year. Zoolander 1 was an iconic film with incredible lines I quote to this day, but Zoolander 2 was a film up its own ass using rehashed jokes and just terrible performances from everyone. All the cameos felt crap, Hansel's storyline was so unfunny it hurts and the whole Derek's son thing stopped becoming funny before they started the joke. It's only higher than the others because Will Ferrell has some good lines and I'm a sucker for him.

**1.5/10**

**36. Bitch Slap**

This film stars 3 strippers in what I now realise was a 90 minute tribute to both The Usual Suspects and softcore lesbian porn. When 3 busty ladies drive into the desert with a pimp in the back and tensions are running high, I had hopes for some entertainment but it was one of those films that tried hard to be bad and just came off as awkward. There are many scenes of beautiful women throwing water on their skin tight shirts so if you're into that go ahead. I called the ending and felt proud of that but the rest of it was eh. Lots of violence though and the actor for the pimp at least did a good job. Either that or my standards are in the toilet.

**35. Samurai Cop**

I watched this one as one of the first crap movies on my list, and it is quite the film I must say. A sped up car chase, a charismatic side kick who did reaction faces before it was a thing, a weird interaction with a Costa Rican waiter (please correct me if I'm wrong), enough sex scenes to make Bitch Slap look like a PSA, Robert Z'dar's crazy big chin, in fact it doesn't deserve to be this low on the list but I watched it twice and it wasn't as entertaining the second time. Watch this film, it's fucking sick, fuck it I'm breaking my own rules here. 

**7/10**

****

**34. Mac and Me**

You may remember this film from the clip Paul Rudd uses to fuck with Conan and the McDonalds dance scene. What you dont realise is that that little alien shit has parents and a sister, and they are all fucking terrifying. I have never felt more uncomfortable in a film before than when those beady fucking eyes stared straight into my soul, whilst everyone in the film was supposed to act as if they were cute cuddly creatures that deserved to live and not incinerated. Fucking hell it gave me such anxiety after. If you want a horror film here you go. It's higher than the others in ranking because admittingly it was more entertaining. 

**1.6/10**

****

**33. Hard Ticket to Hawaii**

This film has more titties than most of the 80's films on here, which is saying a lot. It's about 2 girls and they're secret agents vs a drug lord. I don't remember too much because I had to fast forward through the titty scenes due to how uncomfortable it was to watch them with my best friend. There was a snake, at one point one of the girls blows up  a helicopter, theres a cross dressing man inside it, I really liked it at the time, it's just the other films were better. I would recommmend watching this actually. 

**3/10**

****

**32. Troll 2**

THEY'RE EATING HER, AND THEN THEY'RE GOING TO EAT ME. This is the rest of that film. Follows a little kid who is trying to stop his family becoming plants after they go on holiday to a secluded holiday location in Mountain Peaks, CA. I will give credit to this film, it is disgusting, the props, the food they eat, the incredible use of green food colouring truly made me gag at some points. My favourite part was the main villain's actress truly giving it her all in her performance and just completely fucking it up. The subplot of the boyfriends posse just being there to have a good time is the cherry on top to this car crash of a film. I don't wanna spoil most of it but watch this crazy ass film.

**4/10**

****

**31. Zardoz**

Have you ever seen that picture of the Late Sean Connery in a mankini? This is that film, and he doesn't wear anything else. This film was worse than the sum of its parts, it had the main villain who had a penned on mustauche, it had Sean Connery being part of a violent group of raiders being taken to a higher plane, it had the society who was immortal and used aging as punishment, but it was just so dry, and slow, and mind numbing. I want you to watch this film so you can see what I see, and so that you can see the origin of that fateful picture of Sean Connery. 

**4.1/10**

****

**30. Geteven : Road to Revenge**

This film was made as a Vanity Project in the early 90s, it involves the Director, Writer and Producer John De Hart being a ass kicking, country singing, one woman loving badass. In fact, the title doesn't even make sense because he has no reason for revenge really for most of the film so the road is really short. There's a musical number in there that goes for a couple minutes, but I think that the rest of the film of john de hart just enjoying his life with his wife is not enjoyable. the ending is pretty mad though.

*4.5/10**

****

**29. Chopping Mall**

Chopping Mall is one film where the concept is dogshit but the execution was actually really good. The premise is that a group of 3 guys and 3 gals go to a mall after dark and fuck the daylights out of eachother. Unlike what I expected, it was all consensual, they didn't make fun of the nerds for being nerds instead they gave them space, and all the characters were geniunely having a great times. Unfortunately, the mall had new robot guards that were out to murder them all, so ensues a chase across the whole mall where very few of the group get out alive. What got me about this film was the girls weren't damsels in distresses or stone cold characters with daddy issues, they all had a good part to play, which is not expected for a movie made in the 80s. Good on you chopping mall. The robots are like discount Daleks FYI.

**5/10**

**28. Fateful Findings (NB)**

Neil Breen. A legend to those who live on the movie set. Seeing this legends work was just a spectacle. This film should not be called a film, and I should not have spent my time watching it but I did anyway. For those of you unfamiliar with Neil Breen, search up ""I can't believe you comitted suicide"" on youtube, that's a scene from this film. Thank me later. This is one of 5 neil breen films on this list and let me tell you if you're a fan of crap films this is worth the watch. Neil Breen has a sweet ass ferari that he flexes whenever he can, which I respect. The film itself is mindnumbing and not his best work.

**5.5/10**

****

**27. Amos and Andrew**

This film was recommended to me from a friend. It has Nicolas Cage, Samuel L Jackson, and Giancarlo Esposito. The plot is that a famous author (sam jackson)  moves to a sleepy hick town and racism causes his life to be entangled with local loser who was paid to be the fall guy and shit gets out of hand. Having actual actors does increse this films standings in my eyes because there are some good lines but in the end it was pretty forgettable. Nice to see the younger versions of these actors though, Giancarlo is wasted in his current typecasted role of evil calculating man. 

**5.5/10**

****

**26. Traxx**

Oh Traxx. This and Hard Ticket to Hawaii both have their own theme songs, thats the flavour of film you're working with. Traxx is a country boy who comes into the wild and violent city to settle it down as the rag tag crusader he truly is. This film was funny because in hindsight Traxx is a mass murderer but the smoking hot Mayor doesn't care cus he plays by no rules and damnit he gets results. Traxx also has a montage in the middle where he and his sidekick dance by his riverside camp he calls home. Jesus the more I write the more ridiculous this film sounds. 

**6/10**

****

**25. Miami Connection**

What do you get when you cross a karate master, a small budget, a love of guitars and high school, and some kung fu action? You get Miami Connection, a film where a group of orphan highschoolers led by Y K Kim, a 40 year old man, battle ninjas. Seriously, they all live together in the house and the orphan bit is huge. Plus there is actually some kick ass action in this film made my yours truly Y K Kim. I really loved this film and the ending made me cry of laughter. Watch it, I dont want to ruin the surprises in store. 

**6.4/10**

****

**24. Twisted Pair (NB)**

Oh boy. This is Neil Breen's most recent film. It involves Neil Breen's character and his brother Cade, who is a hacker of sorts fighting against the powers that control the world. This is basically the plot of every one of his films FYI, and it's amazing every single time. Neil Breen is known for making ridiculous shit films and this is no exception. The CGI he uses together from Windows Movie Maker coupled with half the film being stock footage he voices over makes for a must watch for any bad movie fan. Personally I've never gotten closer to giving up on movies than I have after seeing this. 

**6.7/10**

****

**23. I am Here...now (NB)**

This too is a neil breen film, and this is about Neil Breen who is God, and comes to Earth to see how humanity is sinning. There is one guy in this film who actually did act well from my shit standards at this point, and he is a drug dealer much like Chris R for those who have seen the film The Room. I am Here...Now is nothing short of ridiculous, with the film not being about hacking and not being about just Neil Breen's character, you get the true scope of how bad Neil Breen is at making films. There are some hilarious bits in this regarding sex trafficking, drug deals gone wrong, people going from super old to super young through the power of God, truly an enlightening film. 

**6.75/10** 

****

**22. Lawnmower Man 2 : Jobe's War**

Fuckin hell this film. The first one is higher up in the list, the premise is this guy who was mentally retarded (I don't know how better to put it) was given the power of becoming smarter through computers by Pierce Brosnan, and Lawnmower Man 2 is set in the distant future when Jobe convinces his child friend to set him free on the world. It's lovely to see such a shit concept done so horribly with such a big budget. The CGI is godawful, the acting even worse. It's a sequel to a film that shouldn't have been made in the first place.

**6.75/10**

****

After this point I can comfortably say all the films below are fun to watch, it's just my personal preference on ranking. 

****

**21. Kill Point**

Another Leo Fong flick. Leo Fong is an icon and legend, and in Kill Point he plays an FBI Liutenant going after a  notorious gang leader involved in an arms deal played by the Legendary Stack Pierce. This film has it all, action, drama, comradery and shit lighting. Seriously a lot of the action is filmed at night and you can't see properly. This one is so high because of my love for Leo Fong and Stack Pierce mainly, and if you can't tell by now I need better things to do with my time. 

**7/10** 

****

**20. Deadly Prey**

An elite team of mercenaries train by chasing down the deadly prey of Man, but this time, they fucked with the wrong guy. Mike Danton. My hero,  a roided up monster of a soldier who makes the hunters the hunted. This film is just such a rip off of predator and kinda boring sometimes but I really enjoyed it. Even though it isn't higher, it is required watching as you will find out why.

**7/10**

****

**19. Mystery Men**

Starring Ben Stiller and Hank Azaria, Mystery Men is a film about people with mediocre superpowers and how they stop the main villain played by Geoffrey Rush as he tries to destroy the world or some shit. The acting carries this film, with Stiller, Azaria, and Barbosa, its concept is really bad but the actual film is weirdly charming in a way. Fun Fact: this film was the one in the music video for All Star by Smash Mouth. Look it up.

**7/10**

****

**18. Star Wars Holiday Special**

When watching Star Wars did you think to yourself ""I need to know what Chewbaccas family do."" So did I, and thankfully George Lucas created this absolute monstrosity. A majority of this film is in Wookie and there are no subtitles. Theres a weird infomercial in the middle, and you can see how dead inside Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill and Carrie Fischer are in this. This is frankly a must watch for any star wars fan, and I'm not even a fan and saw it. It's incredible, one of the few on this list where I can't put into words how crazy it is. There's a random animated section for Luke in it that is nightmare fuel. Watch it.

**LSD Trip/10**

****

**17. Adventures of Power.**

This film is like Mystery Men where the concept is ridiculous but the actual film is charming af. It's about Power, a young man from a mining town and his dream to become an Air Drumming champion. Not normal drumming, the more difficult Air Drumming. There is also a B Plot about the mining town being under siege due to no pay or some shit but it's secondary to the compelling Air Drumming competition towards the end. A true thrilling coming of age story, I don't think this is a must see in this list but I did genuinely enjoy it for what it was.

**7.2/10**

****

**16. Baseketball**

Trey Parker and Matt Stone were made famous from this film, about two losers who create a sport that's a mix between Basketball and Baseball. There's nothing clever about it, it's got some good jokes and just a fun rise and fall of two friends blinded by the lights of stardom. It's just quite enjoyable, and Trey Parker and Matt Stone did a great job of playing themselves as the two protagonists of this story. Both this film and Adventures of Power have scary texan oil barons as villains FYI.

**7.5/10**

****

**15. Double Down (NB)**

Oh shit. Neil Breen's first film is a doozy. He plays a hacking mastermind bio terrorist who lives in the desert and polluts rivers with chemical weapons whilst also making us think he is the good guy. You get to see his nutsack in his debut film and it's everything you'd hope for. The ending montage of Neil Breen running around the same desert rocks is something to bring tears of laughter to your eye. Fuckin hell Neil. I've seen this 4 times.

**7.7/10**

****

**14. Pass Thru (NB)**

This is his best work. If you've seen the infamous ""isn't that corrupt?"" clip on youtube , Pass Thru is the one where it comes from. Funnily enough this is my favourite Neil Breen film and it has the least amount of Breen, involving more hacking, more trafficking and drugs, and in the end the girl who was too high to be repulsed by him runs off with him into the sunset. It had the trademark Breen Stock Footage and shit CGI but it had more terrible acting from other people, rounding out the shit sandwich that is this film. 

**7.9/10**

****

**13. The Skateboard Kid**

Have you ever looked at your skateboard and thought ""I wish it could talk."" Well Skateboard Kid has you covered! This sentient skateboard helps this 90s kid after some wacky circumstances as most 90s films are, eventually helping him run from the government and nearly kill his bullies. The chase scene is very reminiscent of better movies that do the same concept, so watch out for that. God I can't believe I watched this. It was fun though.

**8/10**

****

**12. Tenet**

I don't know why this film is in this list but I said 42 films in the title and you can't edit it. I guess Tenet was ok, I couldn't hear half the shit people said most of the time but all in all a fun film with loads of twists and turns. Robert Pattinson is always beautiful 

**N/A**

****

**11. Who killed Captain Alex? 

UGANDAN ACTION MOVIE WHO KILLED CAPTAIN ALEX? Mate this film is fucking incredible. I loved watching it and I love the fact that their budget was only 60 dollars but they made the most of it. I almost felt bad laughing because the actors truly give it their all and sell the ridiculousness to the level it deserves but the director was ok with it so laugh away. Absolute pure fun as a film, better than some action films I've seen, even though at the end of the film I couldn't actually figure out who killed captian alex. It's incredible.

**9/10**

****

**10. Order of the Black Eagle**

Nazis can fuck off, and discount James Bond with his monkey companion cannot agree more. Part spy film, part western, part vietnam, this film has it fucking all man. So fun to watch, loads of inconsistencies and the monkey plays such a big part I did not expect halfway through. Hitler is being recreated and it's up to our intrepid heroes to take down the Order of the Black Eagle using a fuckton of explosives and bravado. Watch this shit.

**9.1/10**

****

**9. The Room**

Those of you who don't know the room, it's the grandaddy of all these films in terms of popularity. A story about a succesful bank worker and the infidelity of his girlfriend and best friend, it's so dogshit in all the right ways. It was my gateway drug to this shitshow of a thread you are reading right now. Tommy Wiseau can't act to save his life, and the rest of the cast have to pick up the pieces left by this agent of chaos as the film goes on. Absolute masterpiece.

**9.2/10**

****

**8. Orgazmo**

Another film created by the lovely people behind Southpark, finds a mild mannered Mormon who finds himself in porn because he needs to make ends meet. He has a stunt cock, all he needs to do is act the role of Orgazmo, the hero of all these tales. The best part about this is not the incredibly funny jokes but the Villain, Max Orbestein, still being the best villain in this whole list of films. Absolutely great film.


**9.4/10**

****

**7. Suburban Saquatch**

When you think of Sasquatch, do you think of a 5 foot hairy man with giant titties and nipples that nearly cover them? Because suburban sasquatch fulfills that fucked up fantasy you have. It has everything, gore, magic, cops who need to redeem themselves, a reporter who needs one big scoop to make it into the big leagues and a native american woman chasing her destiny. The result? a giant clusterfuck of mania that moves from scene to scene without rhyme or reason. It's beautiful. At one point the sasquatch rips open a poodle like a christmas cracker. Must watch, was crying of laughter.

**9.5/10**

****

**6. Love on a Leash**

A party boy gets punished by a waterfall god for being horrible to women by being turned into a dog. A literal dog. It happens off screen, but it sets the scene for our tale about a young woman who is obsessed with the colour green, and her attempts at finding love in her sleepy town of wherever the fuck USA. Her social circle consists of her toxic mother and even more insane best friend, whilst the dog has to convince this woman to *fall in love with her* so that he can turn into a human again. I bet you 1000 pounds you wont predict the ending. 

**9.5/10**

****

**5. Low Blow**

Leo Fong's Magnum Opus. A story about a Private Eye with a shit care and his attempts to thwart a cult led by a very drunk and out of it Cameron Mitchell. Stack Pierce also stars, remember him? This film is genuinely funny, from the constant soundtrack for the first 40 minutes of the film to the constantly breaking car to the night fight scenes where you cant see a fucking thing. Cameron Mitchell is only seen stood up twice in this film, that's how fucked he was making this. God this film was a trainwreck.

**9.6/10**

****

**4. Lawnmower Man**

Pierce Brosnan stars in the film Lawnmower Man, where he takes a persons lower intelligence and puts it into the stratosphere. Pierce Brosnan is the highest name actor I've seen so far in these films and even he couldn't save this shit show. Jobe's progression from idiot to divine god is just so bad, and the cgi is all sorts of godawful. I can't believe this got greenlit at all, it's such a shit film that it has to go this high. Fucking Lawnmower man. My head hurts thinking about it. 

**9.9/10**

**3. Hawkeye**

This is by Leo Fong but he doesn't star, instead we have a budget budget discount knock off Rush Hour vibe going on with a main Chinese actor who hates children and an Eddie Murphy lookalike who is actually pretty good. It's a decent buddy cop film with both at each others throats at the start then becoming friends as time goes on. I did enjoy this a lot more than every other film and would consider watching it again, which says a lot.

**9.9/10**

****

**2. Ben and Arthur**

Let's say you're a gay man and you just got married. Wouldn't it be weird if your religious brother becomes a homicidal maniac? That's what happens in the story of Ben and Arthur, a  beautiful gay couple who are terrorised by Ben's psycho religious brother. There is too much gold in this film to list, from when Ben's brother Victor murders people like its nothing to Ben setting a church on fire and nobody else mentioning it. I had to pause it sometimes cus I was laughing too hard. Absolute masterpiece of awful. 

**10/10**

****

**1. Deadliest Prey.**

This is it. Number one. The sequel to deadly prey, made 16 years later. Absolutely brilliant. It's amazing how this film is a step by step remake of the first film just with the actors being significantly older so they can't do the stunts any more. There is a Ben Wyatt look alike in this so watch out for him. It's incredible, and there are many twists and turns that are exactly the same as the first one that you should be sure to accept. Just the sheer audacity to remake the film shot by shot blew my mind, and this film brought me to tears laughing so it gets the top spot.

**1000/10**

175,"Jurassic Park 3 is a much better movie than Jurassic World I'm probably gonna get a lot of backlash for saying this but I mean think about it: it's better paced, there aren't any useless scenes that don't go anywhere, it's better shot, or should I say better edited, the CGI special effects look much more realistic and lifelike (they totally do, the dinosaurs in Jurassic World look like a bunch of cartoons, mostly because of how their seemingly boneless bodies move) and it's an all around much more entertaining movie.

Sure the characters are awfully annoying and there's a lot of cheesy, campy moments (ALAN!, anyone?) but.........I know it's kinda strange to say but I prefer cheesiness to complete blandness. I would take an ALAN! moment any day over the endless sea of boredom that is Jurassic World. It's such an unremarkable movie, there's absolutely nothing memorable about it and on top of that it's really boring, mainly due to how it's shot. I mean JP 3 wasn't really a great looking movie, that stupid grey color tint they put over every single frame definitely made it look a lot uglier, but there's some interesting lighting going on and some of the shots actually look really cool.

JW has NONE of that, lighting only exists to show what's happening and it's very much what I like to call a ""place the camera, shoot the shot"" movie. There's no artistry in the camera work and it feels really phoned it. JP 3 also kinda falls into that category but there's just so much more energy and passion in the directing, you can just feel that director Joe Johnston definitely cared about what he was doing and did his best to make it look as appealing as possible.

Bottom line I think both movies are not really that good, but at the very least Jurassic Park 3 delivers some good fun moments and is technically superior. When I first watched Jurassic World I was shocked to find out that it is only two hours long, because after watching it in its entirety it felt MUCH longer than that. Jurassic World has very, VERY little to offer both as a Jurassic Park movie and as a movie in general in my opinion, while JP 3 at least delivers some good thrills, occasional chuckles and also feels like a Jurassic Park movie, a very dumbed down version of a JP movie but a JP movie nonetheless.",0

Does the movie *Heat* want us to think that Neil’s credo, namely that “you should never get so attached to anything that you are not willing to walk away from it in 30 seconds if you see the heat around the corner” is misguided? For my money, when he holds Al Pacino’s hand at the end and says “I told you I wasn’t going back”, he might as well be Jesus Christ on the cross saying “It is finished.” Neil, and Al Pacino as well, have both truly done their duty, both to themselves and to each other, in a real Kierkegaardian sense.

Not all of the selections are 'great' movies, and I hope you join me every week as I explore the wide universe of Sci-Fi Cinema.

You may also be able to find it at your local library.

""We did research on robots, \[but\] the most fun was to research jewel thieves. When you read about those guys —really high-class jewel thieves, ones that pull off these big heists—they talk about their work like artists. They’re not doing it for the money, because you really can’t spend it, if you’re stealing famous jewels, they’re hard to spend, so the heists are like these little art projects for them. It’s all about proving what they can do; they love it in the same way that an artist does. So that was sort of fun. It’s buried in the movie, and I don’t know if many people would pick up on it, but for me it’s sort of about how being an artist can screw up your relationships—what that did to Frank’s family. I think that’s something that most people that try to do this stuff can relate to, how hard it is to kind of juggle that passion for the craft while trying to maintain real relationships with people.""[\- Jake Schreier](https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/jake-schreier-robot-frank)",0

Colonel Stuart is a much colder, more calculating villain than Hans Gruber, threatening to kill his own men in comparison to the joking relationship Hans has with his. The movie has absolutely no qualms about killing civilians, with a plane crashed just to prove a point, and the token SWAT team, who are simply wounded in the original, are mercilessly gunned down in this one. Gore is ramped up across the board and the kills have a much more mean spirited feel to them.

The choice to go darker doesn’t seem to be unique to Die Hard 2, with Temple of Doom famously being a much darker film than Raiders of the Lost Ark. So my question is simply what other sequels also make this choice to go darker?",0

She appears in this film for about ten seconds in the background. She  is however in the credits as Cousin Linny (her first name misspelt as Caroline.)

When the protagonist meets Kat at the restaurant, she basically explains her part in the end of the movie.  Left on a boat, comes back, sees woman diving off, and Sator was gone.  

So that all makes sense, but why is Sator still around if he died?  I guess the only thing that makes sense is the Sator we see in the movie is a different version that has traveled back and existed along side the one that was killed?  But he has no clue his other self is missing?

195,"Benny's Video - Unpleasant Movies Unpleasant Movies is a podcast dedicated to harsh and unrelenting cinema, films that are tough to sit through but rewarding to discuss and think about. 

For this episode we are talking about Haneke's second feature - Benny's Video from 1992. Its about a teenage boy obsessing over VHS tapes and death, invites a girl home while his well-to-do parents are away on a trip. Surely the perfect setting for a romantic debut...  

A little overlooked perhaps, certainly not his most talked about movie, I still think its a really good starting point for talking about how Haneke approaches characters, situations and themes. Its his most overtly media-skeptic piece and his concern over a screen-obsessed youth seem even more relevant today with tik-tok and the like. Benny's parents are fairly absent, leaving him to do as he likes most of the time. His father in particular is clearly more concerned with his career and issues of social standing than acting responsibly. When Benny reaches out to them, they choose self preservation above all else. Though he doesn't express it emotionally, to me it seems that what he really wants is a world where actions lead to consequences, a system that is understandable and perhaps trustworthy - something his parents fail to provide. 

Anyway, we had a very interesting chat about it - check out the episode if you like on any of the usual podcast providers:

198,"Buster keaton or Charlie chaplin, who was more talented? Putting aside who you think was funnier for a moment, who do you think was actually more talented, and skilled at their art? 

Both are spectacular at what they did, Charlie Chaplin's slapstick, directing, overall coordination and even his dramatic acting skills were pretty incredible. Watching modern times, or the great dictator shows you just how much control he had over his movements, and his almost pitch perfect timing. (See shaving sequence in the great dictator for reference).

Buster Keaton on the other hand, was possibly the world's best stuntman. What he managed to achieve in the 1920s is incredible, and he never shyed away from something dangerous. However, he also had some serious chops in other areas. His directing is pretty impeccable, and just like Chaplin had some serious control over his body movements. In sherlock jr, he manages to hit every single ball on a pool table except the one ""explosive ball"". He then proceeds to flex even more and pot them all creatively without ever touching the ball. It's hilarious, but also extremely impressive.

I know it's a hard question to answer, and in some ways like comparing apples to oranges, but who do you think was a more talented performer overall?

Personally, I'm going to go with Chaplin, because he's good at such a wide range of things, even if keaton has him beaten in some areas",0

I have a really basic question. Why do the Agents try to kill using guns and so many rounds of ammunition?

205,"Fluctuating video quality from streaming services ruins films I remember when I used to watch movies on DVD. I was young at the time but I used to think the quality was great, and it stayed that way throughout the whole film.

Now, conversely, while I mainly watch films in HD (better than DVD) from streaming services, I'm incredibly distracted when the quality drops even slightly, and I have to pause or rewind to let the film buffer correctly.

I have a pretty good internet connection, and most things buffer in HD fine when I have the option to set the quality. But yesterday, I tried watching a movie on MUBI's streaming service and found it utterly atrocious that the film would begin in HD, then randomly drop to a lower quality and never recover, necessitating constant rewinding to ensure good quality throughout. Peacock is similar too. Netflix used to have a secret quality assurance switch which they inexplicably got rid of. If I'm paying for your streaming service, I should have the right to stream movies in the quality of my choice.

Not enough services have download options to ensure the best quality with no buffering. The Netflix app has it for the PC, but I've never been able to get it to work. The Amazon app has it, but if you toggle it to ""Best"" quality, all of the films run into an error code at 54 mins and 30 seconds. iPlayer is really the only site that has a working download function.

The advent of streaming has been a blessing, but also a curse if you're OCD about video quality. How many times have you watched an action film only for the video quality to get profoundly worse during the best bit - the action itself?",0

Following the film's financial and critical success, the studio has begun working on a sequel. Jon Favreau and Justin Marks were in talks to return as director and writer respectively while Brigham Taylor was confirmed to be returning as producer. Shortly after the release of the film, Favreau and Marks signed on to direct and write the sequel, and it could potentially have a release sometime in late 2019 and will be shot back-to-back with Favreau's remake of The Lion King. But in March 2017, it was reported that the sequel was put on hold so that Favreau would have to focus mainly on The Lion King instead. By January 2018, Marks finished an early draft for the sequel, which he said will ""go further through"" Kipling's material, as well as feature elements of Bill Peet's rejected drafts for the 1967 film. In October 2018, Neel Sethi confirmed that he will reprise his role as Mowgli in the sequel.",0

Then I tried watching Mutiny on the Bounty (1962). I got so far as to see Marlon Brando portraying the same Fletcher Christian as a foppish dandy. I did not watch any further.

Then there's The Bounty (1984) with a pretty stacked cast (Gibson, Hopkins, Olivier, Day-Lewis, Hill, Neeson). I haven't seen this one in a long long time and am going to watch it again tomorrow.

I dare you to have a few glasses of wine and not feel like crying when Nemo hears about his dads journey. I think its the peak of the film. You're watching all these little pieces of plot (the first swim, the sharks, the jellyfish, the turtles) and its not until the pelican tells Nemo about all these feats that its fully juxtaposed with our initial impressions of Marlin and our expectations of what he could be capable of.

And the swim down is the second parts that solidifies his growth in accepting his son (and Dory). Not only does he trust his sons advice even though Nemo ""isn't a good swimmer,"" but he uses the advice Dory has been saying the whole film, ""Just keep swimming,"" and save a whole bunch of people (fish).

There would have been no reason for Marlin to change until he met more disabled people and experienced their strengths in spite of their weaknesses, faced his fears, was able to meet many new kinds of people, lifestyles, and new perspectives.

\- Bong Joon Ho's [Korean horror film](https://collider.com/bong-joon-ho-next-movie-after-parasite/) since I really liked Parasite and loved his back catalogue.

\- Na Hong-jin's [serial killer movie](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/8302v8/the_next_film_by_na_hongjin_director_of_the/), I FUCKING LOVE *The Wailing* and it was so unique in the horror genre that I actually checked out *The Chaser* and really loved it. I'm gonna try to watch *The Yellow Sea* if I have time.

\- Park Chan-wook's [murder-romance film](https://www.indiewire.com/2020/10/park-chan-wook-handmaiden-follow-up-film-decision-to-leave-1234592451/) since I watched *Oldboy* and liked, then I watched *Lady Sympathy* and then I FUCKING LOVED IT, then finally I watched *The Handmaiden* and I WAS BLOWN AWAY by it that I watched it two times. I think he's my favorite out of the New Korean Wave directors.

\- There's also  Japanese auteur, Hirokazu  Koreeda, which I am currently binge watching his back catalogue after I watched *Shoplifters* and a few days ago, I just read that he's making a [South Korean film](https://variety.com/2020/film/asia/hirokazu-kore-eda-broker-song-kang-ho-1234749096/) so I am very excited how he's going to pull this one off.

221,"2020 is the first year since 2007 with no Billion Dollar movies - Could 2019 be the last? With only 10 days to go in the year and Wonder Woman's ugh.. poor performance in the international box office,it got me thinking.

With all the moves that WB has made to move into the streaming world, it seems like the future of the industry is resting pretty much on the back of Disney, if it wasn't already. For now, they seem pretty committed to keeping things in theatres (much to everyone's surprise I think), but I was wondering what the next billion dollar film might be (if theatres can survive in their current form).

Universal might be able to clutch it with a well placed Fast and Furious/Jurassic World film (which are both upcoming), but if they fail to capture the eye of audiences, it's very unlikely. Sony would be next with either Bond or one of their Spiderman properties, but coming off a lukewarm reception to Spectre and never quite reaching the billion dollar mark with spiderman before, I think that's equally unlikely. Paramount could be a dark horse with Transformers, however I believe their next movie is in 2022. 

Now this basically leaves Disney, in which case I believe you can write off all of their 2021 MCU films. To get people back out into theatres globally, the vaccine is going to have to be rolled out practically worldwide before we can get anywhere close to numbers we were seeing pre-pandemic, so I think the MCU movies might just be able to ramp us up to the best chance at a billion dollar movie next year: Avatar. 

It's always said that you shouldn't underestimate James Cameron, and with two of the three highest grossing films of all time under his belt, you can see why. He might really pull it out of the bag with this new Avatar film, and with people raring to get back into cinemas (and hopefully hot off the heels of some great MCU momentum), I think it has the best chance of becoming the next billion dollar film, and the only one to achieve the status in 2021. Potentially it could be the last ever billion dollar film if the industry continues to move toward streaming.

After that point, who knows.",0

Upon watching it for the first time I was quickly under the impression that this movie was so loved for its value as a “campy” film. Much like Tommy Wiseau’s The Room.

Guys, despite being entertaining, this is a bad movie. 

The characters constantly make terrible decisions, and everyone acts as a caricature of themselves. To be clear, this is fine if the movie is tonally consistent, but it takes itself far too seriously and doesn’t seem aware of just how ridiculous every action made is. (Again similar to The Room)

The very fact that I know a movie didn't release in cinemas makes it seem boring to me. It doesn't even matter that I wouldn't have seen it in the cinema - if I know it was released directly on disc or streaming, I'll feel like it didn't matter. And therefore I can't really get into it. 

Imagine if Avengers: Endgame was released directly to Disney+ now. How lame would that be? People would talk about it for a week or two and then nobody would care anymore. I want movies to be big events and I want people to talk about them for a long time. I want them to feel special. With so many of them being released to streaming they just blend together and lose relevance a few days after release.

When I'm looking at Metacritic or IMDb I now see so many movies that absolutely nobody would've cared about if they hadn't been in cinemas. And I'm also seeing a lot of movies that nobody cares about that would've been highly-rated if they came out in cinemas. It's actually really sad. 

I'm pretty sure now that all those Netflix movies people find ""meh"" aren't actually that meh. They're just meh because they feel irrelevant because they've been released online only. I always thought it was weird how specifically these movies aren't that well liked, and I honestly pin this on nothing but the format they've been released in. It has little to do with the movies themselves. Even the great ones, like The Irishman or Uncut Gems are only talked about for a very short time before becoming irrelevant.

Right now I'm at a point where I've almost completely stopped watching movies. Streaming completely takes the magic out of movies for me. It feels so wrong. These films weren't made for this. Movies were something special for me. Now they feel like nothing more than elaborate internet videos. And it makes me really sad.",0
236,"Ride a Crooked Trail (1958)-A charming and funny film that inescapably reminds me of a certain First Couple Now, I don't mean to get overly political or present sides in this forum.  I'm a little ways into this really great movie starring Walter Matthau as the town Judge, and a supporting cast I don't know.

Without spoiling to too much, it's about a case of mistaken identity, a genre I adore, and this one plays it exceptionally well.   In summary, a bank robber is mistaken as the new Town Marshall, and to save himself, he presents his accomplice as his wife.  Everyone is determined to believe this 'fine young man' is the great marshall they need to set the town straight-but all he and his 'wife' want is to rob the bank and flee.

Matthau is unforgettably strong character that let's his hopes fool him, and the townsfolk are too used to following his lead to question anything.  So, I hope some others will chime in if they've seen it.  I never have, and 33 minutes in I'm hooked.",0

The line is a call back from a 5 second scene early in the movie where John Cusak’s character was reminded that his daughter has to wear pull-ups to bed. Fast forward 1.5 hours of Volcanoes blowing, continents falling into the ocean, cargo planes flying under falling skyscrapers, and barely surviving by boarding an ark. They made it, they survived this worldwide disaster and are surveying their new world from the deck of the boat.

254,"Why was Wonder Woman received so much better than Captain Marvel? They're both each of their company's flagship female superheroes, the first big female superheroes in this golden age of cinematic universes. 

Their first movies were somewhat divisive: Wonder Woman's third act is widely criticized as a bad CGI extravaganza, and Diana becoming almost a co-star to love interest Steve Trevor earned some derision as well. Captain Marvel is considered a needless throwback to the MCU's more bland origin stories, with an egregiously overpowered main character that lowers the stakes. 

Wonder Woman has two movie appearances more than Captain Marvel, though it can be argued that her portrayal in the terrible Justice League might have represented a step back for the character. 

And yet, there's no doubt that Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is more popular and more well-liked than Brie Larson's Captain Marvel. Is it just politics? Larson is one of the most hated celebrities on the internet, true, but Gadot is not a stranger to online criticism either. 

I believe it ultimately comes down to their performance. Larson may be an Oscar winner but she was, in my opinion, woefully miscast as Carol Danvers. She's a far better actress than Gadot in a technical sense, but she's missing that charisma or spark that Gadot brought to the role of WW. Furthermore, I believe Larson had the additional misfortune of playing a character that was never really well-defined by the writers/directors. In contrast, Gadot is a fairly limited actress but Patty Jenkins knew just how to harness that kind of charisma and personality that Larson lacks into a likeable performance that suited the character.",0
255,"New method to separate the junk for the gold. So I have watched many movies all those years... noticed that at about 2010 and upwards things in the movie industry got downhill... lowest common denominator rushed out scripts scenes reboots of reboots of reboots etc... 

And I found myself on netflix where I already watched the few good movies that it has right now so I am in a hopless journey of going through the dozens of junk movies it has only to be able to fill the home screen with thumbnails to give you an illution of variety. 
                                   


But hey... one of them might actually be interesting.. who knows? That's why I am keeping on this journey! :P                               


During that I discovered a very nice effort that will save me some time! 


What I do is open a movie that I dont know / or my gut tells me it will be junk or boring and then on an other tab I open a game of chess :P (something that interest you it doesnt have to be chess you just could read some news feeds or whatever it doesnt have to be sound invlolved though e.g watching youtube videos)           
        
If in the first 10 to 20 minutes  I just hear some rumble and my brain doesnt even want to pay attention to the dialogues or is curious about what happens in the movie (which I cant see but is still playing on an other tab so I can hear it) then it means that the movie is going to be junk and I leave it....


Seriously if movie producers could just do that before finishing their junk we would either have less such movies or better ones eithercase the movie scene would be better :P 


P.S so why don't I just watch 10-20 minutes of a movie without doing something else? Well I am a compassionate guy if I watch it I will try to ""give it a chance"" and say hey maybe the next scene will be promising, maybe the plot will become better etc... but it doesnt and I end up watching the hole thing... 

If the movie is polished and good/interesting enough to catch my attention while hidden and me playing chess then it probably wont have what it takes to be a good movie :P  It's things you only subconsiosly notice like the background sounds and/or music or the quality of the acting voices (yes actors need to train their verbal skills as well) etc you watch the movie and you miss those blunders but if you do something else and still not notice a movie is playing means that all those things are bad... on a good movie something will catch your ear or imagination (like WTF was that sound?  or why did she asked him that? or wow something cool is happening)",0

So many funny scenes and scenarios, Seth Rogan’s character going through the fears of being a first time father while tripping on various drugs throughout the movie sets up some golden moments (one being James haha).

On the opposite side you have actors who seem to play the same character in every movie. I usually think of Ryan Reynolds in this regard. While I do like Ryan Reynolds it seems like every role for him is just “Deadpool-lite.” That even goes for roles before he took the Deadpool role.

269,"The Road to El Dorado (2000) is a criminally overlooked movie, with hilarious lead characters, gorgeous animation, a beautiful score, and heavily implied LGBT representation. Road to El Dorado came out during that experimental action/adventure animation era (around the time that Atlantis: The Lost Empire came out) that blended 2D and 3D animation and more mature themes. 

This movie is just a great ride, with high-energy, quippy comedy that revolves our two lead characters who are close “friends” and rag-tag con men. 

Watching the film in 2020, it’s kind of amazing how well the animation holds up - it’s stunningly beautiful, and a great score to boot that really sells the action and comedy. 

In addition, our two male leads are quite unambiguously gay. Granted, it isn’t officially framed that way as it was the 2000s, but it’s pretty hard not to notice the implications, especially when watching with a modern lens. There’s even a third act subplot when one of the leads gets involved with a local woman and the other becomes jealous. You could definitely choose not to read it this way, but it’s a pretty widely accepted rumor that the original script had them written as gay men. 

It’s just a fun, well-made film that feels a lot like Dreamwork’s take on The Emperor’s New Groove. And in my opinion, it’s at least as good as that movie. I really recommend you check it out!",0

*It's a Wonderful Life*

*It's a Wonderful Life* (Black & White Version)

Quick history of this movie's colorization - Frank Capra actually wanted to colorize the film himself but the project was canceled when the movie was found to be public domain.

Since then the movie has been colorized 3 times and Frank Capra became staunchly opposed because he was not allowed to oversee how his work was colorized (and I'm gonna guess he didn't make a dime off it either).

So to me it is wrong to list the colorized version of *It's a Wonderful Life* as if it's the ""main"" edition of the film. The film's black and white cinematography is gorgeous in its own right and the end nightmare sequence is some of Capra's most striking images.

This isn't a rant against anyone who enjoys the colorized version, people like what they like, but it is an alternate version and should be listed as such.

Secondly I do not know about any smaller budget indie films or independent movies coming out, so if you ask why a certain Indie film is not on my list then I probably don't know that they even exist.

Finally this list is strictly my own personal opinion, so if my list isn't in an order you like, or if there is a certain film that should be in my list that isn't...well then that's probably why. Also I'd be interested to read your list.

Anyways, with that out of the way, let's begin:

1. A tie between Dune and The Matrix 4 - Yep, out of all the films coming out in 2021, there are no two other films I am excited to see more then the Matrix 4 and Dune (which is why they are both tied as my number 1) I'll start with the Matrix 4. I absolutely loved the first film, I thought the second movie was an alright Guilty Pleasure that had it's moments to shine, & the third one...well....the less said about the third one, the better. But I have faith that the Wachowskis can learn from there mistakes and make an incredibly awesome proper finale to the series, if this is what it will be, & I believe it will be an excellent movie. With Keanu Reeves and Trinity herself apparently returning, & Hugo Weaving's Daughter (who I loved in Bill & Ted 3) being in the movie as well. On top of that from the looks of things, it may be returning to what made the first Matrix movie great. So yeah, pretty hyped. As for Dune, I'll admit I've never actually read the original book, nor have I ever watched the last attempt at trying to make Dune into a movie, but from the trailer alone, it looks pretty solid. Denis Villeneuve's direction looks absolutely breath taking, & the worlds and universe seen in the trailer looks very incredible as well. Not to mention very unique. It actually looks more like something out of Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones then it does something like Star Trek or Star Wars. Not to mention the film looks to have a stellar cast. Either way I am pretty hyped for this movie, after Blade Runner 2049, I have faith that Villeneuve will make an excellent Sci-Fi film.

2. Last Night In Soho - I'm not even a fan of horror movies, & yet I am still hyped for this movie. Why? Because Edger Wright is directing it. That should probably tell you how much I love Edger Wright as a director. I absolutely loved the Cornetto Trilogy (especially Hot Fuzz, which is probably one of my favorite comedies of all time) and Baby Driver, & I think this film looks incredible. Not to much it has a stellar cast, and the premise sounds very interesting and could make for an amazing psychological horror film on the same level as something like Get Out or Midsommar (yes I know I said I didn't like horror movies but...well...let's just say my GF doesn't think the same as me). On top of that it's a unique mash up, Edger Wright directing a psychological horror movie, how awesome is that. 

3. The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent - Nicolas Cage producing and starring in a movie about himself re-visiting his most iconic characters, do I even need to explain any further.

4. MCU Spider-Man 3 - Like I said, this list is my own opinion, & in my opinion out of all the MCU movies and TV shows coming out in Phase 4, Spider-Man 3 is the second most anticipated out of all of them (I say second because...Well...you know...MARVEL's What if...?), & I think there's is a lot too look forward too, on the one hand it will continue from that awesome set up from FFH, with Spider-Man/Peter Parker now on the run after Mysterio framed him for what happened in London, & having to clear his name because of this, a concept I think would interesting exploring, especially since this means we can have villains like Kraven and Scorpion in the film, maybe Mysterio will even make a grand return, but on the other hand it also looks to be a Multiverse story featuring Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield's Spider-Man as well as Alfred Molina's Doc Ock, Jaime Foxx's Electro, and possibly even the OG MJ and Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy...Which is were my worries start to kick in, if you asked me how hyped I was for Spidey 3 before this Spider-verse news came out, it would probably be number 2 or tied with both Matrix 4 and Dune as my number 1 somehow, but now that has changed, & don't get me wrong. Seeing Maguire and Garfield as there respective versions of the Web head is freaking awesome & it'll be cool seeing Molina return to one of his more iconic performances and Foxx being given a second chance at playing Electro after having to play discount Doctor Manhatten/One Man Blue Man Group in that Abomination from 2014, but I do hope they focus more on the On the Run stuff and less on the Multiverse stuff, or at least find a way to blend them together in a way that feels organic, because I feel it's too early to do the Multiverse stuff and I kindof wanted to see a more grounded (no pun intended) Spidey on the Run story to be honest. But even with that being said, like I said, yeah, seeing Maguire and Garfield back as there respective Spider-men will still be pretty sweet, & I think if done right this film could find a way to organically combine the Multiverse story and Spidey on the Run story extremely well. That & I am just so hyped for MCU Spider-Man after Far From Home, I wasn't the biggest fan of Homecoming, but I absolutely loved FFH, & I am hyped for whatever MCU Spidey throws my way.

5. Ridley Scott's The Last Duel - Not much on this one, but judging by the plot dealing with the last Duel to ever be recorded in France's history, & having a pretty decent cast and Legendary director Ridley Scott (and Directing something that ISN'T Alien related, thank god. I know it's his baby but Covenant was not the best movie ever made) I think this one is something worth having in the top five. Because, yeah, it does sound pretty interesting.

6. Elvis - Not much to say here, just a big Elvis buff & I really want to see this Biopic, as I always wanted to see a Biopic about the king on the big screen. Especially when Tom Hanks is involved. 

7. A tie between The King's Man & The Suicide Squad - yep a tie, I'm sorry but that's just simply how I role. Let's start with James Gunn's the Suicide Squad, Unlike the last Suicide Squad film, this one is going to be directed by James Gunn, the same guy who directed Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 1 & 2, as well as 2011 Super. & from how the film looks not only does it look incredibly fun and over the top (right down to some of the costumes looking like they came straight out of the comics) but also it simply just looks incredible. I have huge faith in James Gunn, especially after the Guardians movies, & the simple fact he's willing to embrace the comic books and there obscurities. Now for The King's Man, this film just looks crazy and Insane, I am an absolute huge fan of the first Kingsman movie, the second movie was.....a movie to say the least, but this one looks like it'll be a fun ride. Especially with it being a prequel instead of an actual third movie, though I hope we get a third movie at some point.

8. Raya and the Last Dragon - Not much to say here, the Animation looks incredible, the story sounds intriguing, and overall I think it could make for yet another great entry from Disney. Also it's a relieve to see something original after the wave of Live action remakes we have been getting.

9. Godzilla vs Kong - Another personal pick, but for this one, it's just simply the final showdown we have all been waiting for, I have been a huge fan of Monsterverse so far, & I think it'll be amazing to see these two icons get the rematch they both rightfully deserve. Now hopefully Legendary and WB can work something out so not only can it actually be released, but also so it doesn't have to be delayed again.

10. No Time to Die - I really loved two of the Daniel Craig Bond films (Casino Royale and Skyfall) the other two not so much (Quantum of Solace and Spectre) but hopefully this will lean on the good, if not great side, especially since the film looks fantastic so far.

291,"""The Rookie"" (1990) was such a weird flick *Spoilers*

It is an action comedy buddy cop movie starring Clint Eastwood and Charlie Sheen. That alone sounds intriguing enough. Two Brazilian and Puerto Rican actors (Raul Julia and Sônia Braga, respectively) portray German villains. There is a scene where Clint Eastwood's character literally gets raped by a woman. And his reaction is basically just ""Ugh, how annoying"". The ending has ""the rookie"" (Charlie Sheen) chasing Sônia Braga's character through the airport and then shooting her in the head. They used practical effects and actually destroyed bunch of expensive cars while making this movie. And, ironically enough, there is a scene where Clint says: ""Whoever defaced that work of art [the car] by painting it that color... ought to have his ass removed."" And then there's the scene where Charlie Sheen trashes a bar, beats people up for information and then sets the place on fire.

What a movie. Definitely fun. And memorable.",0

295,"Papers on Modern Film Score trending Hello, just want to throw this out there. Has anyone come across any academic papers or books or articles on trends in modern film scores in historical themed films?

In particular, I am looking for papers or articles which delve into how and why certain  romantic era classical music stylistic elements seems to have over shadowed other classical music styles from 2010 on wards. 

Some Examples
- Qeens Gambit Score 
- Theory of Everything score

Why do the scores sound the way they do and what events in film release history or societal entertainment trends may have influenced those scores to sound the way they do.

296,"Alvin and the Chipmunks (2007) is kind of an overlooked Christmas movie It just feels like you never hear ANYONE talking about Alvin and the Chipmunks, when discussing Christmas movies. This might just be light nostalgia talking, but I kind of like it. Sure, it's not the next ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or whatever. Still, it very comfitably falls within the category of rewatchable comfort Christmas movies like Jingle All the Way.",0
297,"Tenet failed because it tried to do what Dunkirk succeeded in I'm a big Nolan fan, and I don't think its controversial to say that Dunkirk is a far superior film to Tenet.

It got much higher critical acclaim and tbh I can see why. Dunkirk was a very well crafted film, and upon watching both Dunkirk and Tenet again, I understood where I think Tenet primarily went wrong.

Dunkirk did something a bit unconventional in having very vague and thinly developed characters. But this was **intentional**, and in my view it worked. Here we have these soldiers who are no older than 18 or 19, and we're immediately thrown into this hellish nightmare with them. We are *forced* to empathize with them, and the film doesn't have much room to breathe. Its just constant anxiety. 

In my opinion, it works. Dunkirk's primary intent is to force us, the viewer, to feel the anxiety these soldiers felt. Having too many character backstory moments would risk disrupting the flow. 

With Tenet, Nolan again had paper thin characters, but this time it didn't work. Having these thin characters can work in a WW2 biopic, but in a futuristic sci fi thriller? Eh, not as much. We're *supposed* to care about these characters because it seems like Nolan is telling us we should. The film really doesn't do much to make us *feel* that way. So I really did not care for the characters, the same way I did in Dunkirk which is not only based on a real event, but just utilizes superior filmmaking and is more immersive. 

So I appreciate what Nolan did with Dunkirk, but I would really like to see him return to having fleshed out characters. Yeah some people might say he writes bad characters, but fuck it, I cared deeply for Bale's Batman and Coop in Interstellar.",0
298,"""The Lion King"" (1994) theatrical edition on home media? I'm only asking this out of pure curiosity as I don't intend on buying a DVD/Blu-Ray copy of the film or streaming it on Disney Plus; I already have a perfectly fine VHS copy that I can watch whenever. I remember when the ""Special Edition"" DVD came out on the film's 10th Anniversary, and it had a new song included titled ""The Morning Report"". I immediately grew an allergic reaction to it, and even now I still think it's the weakest song in the movie. So I just began wondering if the original theatrical cut - which does NOT include that damn song - ever saw a release after the VHS/LaserDisc era. Well... has it?",0
299,"Best movie quotes of 2020? This may not have been the most prolific year in the industry, but I believe we may come up with some nice quotes from the movies we ended up being able to watch.

300,"Blood Simple (1984) Coen Brothers I don't know exactly where to post my question, but does somebody who also watched the film share the same thought?  

Earlier in the film a story is told by Marty about people in Greece killing the messenger, it makes them feel better about the bad news. In the ending scene Visser is killed by Abby who though it was Marty (''I'm not afraid of you Marty'') Visser in his last breath says '' Well mam, if I see him I sure give him the message'' (Marty is previously killed by Visser, Abby is unaware)

Here I immediately thought the messenger does die in the end, I thought it was a nice touch of detail, but after googling I couldn't find anything, maybe I'm looking for something there is not.",0
301,"What movies are there that don't adhere to common cinematography tropes? What I mean is, the art direction and cinematography doesn't follow the common lighting style of certain genres. I've yet to find many that go against the grain, so it'll be helpful if you guys and gals can provide some suggestions. 

Like say blade runner if it wasn't all dark and moody, but rather bright and sunny (I know it  adds to the story telling in blade runner's case)

Or like a horror movie that is also bright and sunny, no jump scares and stuff.

It just seems like the trend these days is leaning dark and moody, and beyond Hollywood films, even so many indie films and commercial productions seem to follow that stylistic choice.

What really caught my eye with midsommar (at least the trailer, haven't seen the movie) is it seems to be a slasher film that is bright and sunny, which looks refreshing compared to your frat house friends/family stuck in a house with a murderer on the loose at night trope.",0
302,"The Master My thoughts on The Master have changed upon second viewing. I didn't appreciate it on my first watch, but a second viewing was able to make me think about it's themes and interpretations the more as I dig into the film's plot. The writing feels a lot like a thinking device and the cast helps carry it to the screen with their brilliant performances. Casual Moviegoers will write it off as pretentious and nonsensical, but in my opinion, I think The Master is a serious work of brilliance that people will never understand. It's Joaquin Phoenix's best performance in my opinion and the best film of the 2010's.",0

Have I missed a major plot point as to why they’re shooting at the air? I was able to understand the movie but that entire sequence made no sense to me. Is the official script available anywhere which explains what they’re shooting at?",0
304,"Ryan Reynolds should be the new Clark W. Griswold Okay, let's be honest. The reboot of N.L. vacation was a train wreck. Ed Helms is hilarious, but he doesn't have the swagger and charm of a youthful Chevy Chase. In order to understand that role you need to consider the attitude and witt present in Fletch and Caddy shack and then add a family. Goofy, slapstick and still has the possibility of getting into a pool with Christie Brinkley. I know John Hamm is set for the reboot of Fletch, but convince me why Ryan Reynolds wouldn't be better in that part. We will lose that battle, but N.L. Vacation is the war. 

Ryan Reynolds should be the new Clark W Griswold III",0
305,"Chariots of Fire (1981) Chariots of Fire was directed by Hugh Hudson and came out in 1981 in the US. It is mostly known for it's main theme composed by Vangelis. This theme now belongs to pop culture and has emancipated itself from it's original movie. But I'm not here to talk about pop culture, so let's move on.

I guess we could consider this movie as a biopic, since it's based on a true story and is quite close to it. I generally really enjoy biopics for many reasons. But I find this movie to be more than most biopics.

Intimacy. This is how I would describe my experience, the feeling that radiated from this movie. And I think it's thanks to these aspect : The lighting, the composition of the shots, the dialogues, the actors performance and the music that ties everything up into that soft and gentle experience. All of these get you to feel the strength of the character, their hopes, fear and fate. It feels like they are sharing these with you.

But of all the things that I've said above, the lighting, composition etc. Most of theme are usual ones, nothing much special, but perfectly suited for the movie. This handheld camera that gently swivels. The harsh lighting of the interior contrasted with the soft natural lighting of the cloudy outsides. These slow motions picturing the strength and fate of these men. But for me what brings up all of this together is the music. We are mostly used to synphonic music in movies, and more so for movies that take place before the 50's. And that would be what we expect from a movie set in 1920. But Vangelis was charged with making the music, and he isn't renown for his orchestral music. Despite the main theme being largely remembered as a piano music, it's filled with synthetizer music. And for me that is what create this intimate link. The synth music is fairly soft, but lost in a lot of reverb, paradoxically creating a vast space between the viewer and the movies yet such an intimate one. The electronic sounding of the soundtrack perfectly suits the movie. The music is not impressive, nor demonstrative, it's not underlining the amazing achievements these men are accomplishing. No it's not. It's about these men, their feelings, their goal, their battle and their fate. The music that actually stayed with me is Abraham's theme. And for those of you who've listen to Bladerunner's music, you'll find some similarities with it.

If you haven't seen this movie, well I highly recommend it to you. I don't think there is any particular moment or mood to enjoy this movie. So have a great moment, let yourself immerse and enjoy.

Here's the link for the music if you want to listen to it.

306,"Does any actor have a better filmography than Robert De Niro? I mean, this guy's resume is just fucking outrageous. The Godfather Part 2, Goodfellas, Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Once Upon in America, *Dirty Grandpa*, The Deer Hunter, Heat, the King of Comedy...

Even his stuff that's not as iconic as those afformentioned films would be impressive in most other people's filmography: Casino(yet to see it, does it deserve top tier?) The Untouchables, Joker, Cape Fear, The Irishman etc.

It's just insane. I guess you could criticise a lack of variety, as its mostly crime stuff, but apart from that it's a magnificent filmography. So my question is, can anybody name some actors with a comparable filmography to De Niro?",0
307,"Demolition Man (1993) has some scarily accurate predictions of life in the future. When my fiance and I were perusing Netflix the other night, trying to find something to watch, she asked me to stop at Demolition Man, asking me what it was. I told her it was a cheesy action movie from the early nineties, and probably not to her taste. Surprisingly, she wanted to watch it regardless and so as we watched it, the nostalgic memories of watching it as a child came back, but I noticed something else. I can't believe I'm going to say this but...

We both were surprised as some of the parallels to modern life. Let me elaborate...

• Schwarzenegger being president- Sandra Bullock: John Spartan: Hold it. The Schwarzenegger Library?

Lenina Huxley: Yes. The Schwarzenegger Presidential Library. Wasn't he an actor when you...?

John Spartan: Stop! He was President?

This was 10 years before Arnie announced his candidacy as Governor of California, and a humorous nod to Stallone's and his friendship.

• The ""moral statute machines"" that fine you for swearing. We live in an increasingly sensitive age where bad language is censored more and more and even YouTube videos are demonitised for swearing.

• Dr Cocteau having a fricking ZOOM MEETING!

• Lenina Huxley: Ah, smoking is not good for you, and it's been deemed that anything not good for you is bad; hence, illegal. Alcohol, caffeine, contact sports, meat...

I'm just going to leave this here and you can decide if we're pushing towards this or not...

• Driverless cars

• A society of no touching!

There are many more points to note, unfortunately many of which I have forgotten (until the inevitable rewatch) but there was also a reference to a past disaster in which people were ""cocooned"" inside their homes, too afraid to go outside. 

What do you guys think, and what other movies have had some accurate predictions for the future?",0

314,"What's the movie that made you realize movies can be bad? As kids, most of us love anything and everything we see, and I was no different. Transformers films? Get better as they go! Star Wars Prequels? Masterpieces of the highest order! Basically anything from the disney channel? Modern day classics! But inevitably, we one day see a film that shatters our pristine reality, and we come to the realization, that movies can indeed, be bad.

I went to the movie theater one day, a teaser trailer came up showing a hooded figure in a room, surrounded by candles. An ominous voice over came in, describing some sort of grand threat and great power that the figure wielded, as he used martial arts to blow out the candles, first only a few, then by the dozen, then all at once. A beat. He removes his hoodx revealing him to be bald with a tattoo of an arrow on his head.

Holy shit.

Cue epic music, grand final shot, and the title ""The Last Airbender."" I was SO hyped! Avatar was and still is one of my favorite shows, so to see it get a live action adaptation was beyond exciting. I kept up with its production, devouring any and all information about it, usually on nicktoons. I eagerly counted down the days when I could see the movie in all its glory, and when the day finally arrived, i sat down, watched it, and...

It was good. Right?

That was my reaction. I didnt leave with enormous excitement like I was expecting, but with a feeling that what I saw was only ok, at best. I figured I let myself be overhyped. But as time went on, and the more i let it simmer, i had a realization: I saw a movie, that sucked. The reasons for this are numerous, and obvious, but the important thing is on that day, while greatly disappointed, I came out with a new, more critical eye that would see the films for all their flaws, for better and for worse.

Tl;dr, Last Airbender made me realize movies can be bad. What movie was that for you?",0
315,"Bong Joon-ho’s “Mother” (2009) doesn’t get enough attention When most people think of Bong Joon-ho, my guess is they think of *Parasite* or *Snowpiercer*; those are easily his most popular films, and the former is arguably his best. The rest of his filmography isn’t quite as widely known as those two films, but there’s no shortage of (much-deserved) love for *Memories of Murder* and *The Host* among film and horror buffs. His 2009 film, *Mother*, got basically universal praise from critics, but it’s not one I see discussed much. I want to call attention to it because it’s an incredible film that I don’t think should be relegated to minor status in Bong’s filmography.

All of Bong’s hallmarks are there in *Mother*: unusual characters, dark humor, shocking plot twists, and dropkicks.

The film’s premise is really simple: a woman’s developmentally disabled son is accused of a murder and she’ll go to any length to prove his innocence. Kim Hye-ja plays the mother, and her performance is the heart of the film. It’s such an incredible performance that I truly think she should’ve been nominated for an Oscar.

The rest of the cast is fantastic as well, of course, and the story is populated by lots of interesting characters. Jin-Goo plays Jin-tae, a neighborhood shithead who alternates between helping the mother and shaking her down for cash. Like in most of Bong’s films, the characters in *Mother* can’t be categorized into “good” and “bad.” They’re not even necessarily “good people with flaws” or “bad people with good qualities”; their lows are so low and their highs so high that it’s impossible to think of them as either heroes or villains. When Jin-tae is interrogating a couple of assholes with information that could help the investigation, it’s hard not to root for him even as he commits acts of extreme violence; when he demands that the mother pay him $5,000 even though she hardly has any money, it’s hard not to hate him.

The plot is constantly changing directions as the mother’s investigation continues to open up new possibilities. The truth seems obvious at first, but the film never stops introducing new surprises. I’m in love with this film’s last act, and its ending is absolutely perfect.

Despite its relentless bleakness, *Mother* doesn’t feel overwhelming because it’s balanced by the kind of quirkiness you’d expect from a Bong Joon-ho joint. You’ve got a kid trying and failing to dropkick the mirror off a car, a couple of guys chasing golfers around a country club, and an old woman acting delighted at a spinning poop accessory on a cell phone.

If you liked *Parasite* and you want to dive deeper into Bong Joon-ho’s work, I think *Mother* is a great starting point. If you’re not familiar with Bong’s work at all, I still think it’s a stellar and accessible film that anyone who enjoys a good mystery will enjoy.",0

317,"How was the budget for Santa Clause 3 only $12 million? Don’t know how I stumbled through reading trivia on the Santa Clause films with Tim Allen during my last night of finals and going to town on some chocolate truffles, but I was just looking over the IMDB page for The Santa Clause 3 and noticed that tie film is listed as having a budget of $12 million. Is this true or accurate? The budget on the first sequel was $65 million, which seems adequate given the look of the size of that film’s production. But The Santa Clause 3 looks like it has that level of production. 

Am I missing something here? I couldn’t find a discrepancy with the budget numbers in other film archives or databases. My this metric the film is a tremendous success given its box office take, but I know something is missing here. 

Anyways, just thought this was a weird discrepancy to find. I’ve never seen the third film, so for all I know it’s production value really does amount to just $12 million.

Now I recognize that both of those phrases are somewhat common but Arnold’s delivery of both where almost exactly the same as the Borat character.

Or perhaps, since the Boart character was introduced in 96 and Batman and Robin came out in 97, Mr. Freeze was inspired by Borat.

I quite liked the film, I thought the cinematography and performances were great. I really liked the dialogue and individual scenes were great. Sinatra was great in his first major role. 

But I feel like I missed what the movie was going for thematically. Was it a movie about pride? Clift's character was too prideful to box again after blinding a guy. Lancaster was prideful of being an NCO and not becoming an officer like the husband of the woman he's sleeping with. And Sinatra's pride of taking the beatings is what got him killed in the stockades. 

And I simultaneously understand that it's a romance film, which I think worked quite well and thought the theme of pride melded with the romance perfectly. 

But I'm confused with the ending kind of. It's the December 7th attack on Pearl Harbor where Clift gets gunned down by his own men because he didn't listen. Lancaster looks over him and says all he had to do was box and calls him a hothead. Is it tying back into the pride thing? The film ends right after with the two female love interests mourning the loss of Clift. It felt rather abrupt and like it was missing something. Maybe I'm just dumb though.",0

338,"Doubt 2008: Father Flynn and William London (the trouble making blonde boy) I wish I'd seen Doubt more than a decade ago so I could discuss this it on the film's message board back when they existed on imdb and not just have seen it two weeks ago on YouTube. Some random account uploaded a free version of it and mirrored the image: just search Doubt 2008 and it should be the first result it was uploaded 6 months ago.

Anyways, a lot of people theorize that Father Flynn had no been molesting Ronald Miller, but had actually been molesting William London, the trouble making blonde boy who fakes a nose bleed. Since Doubt is written to be deliberately ambiguous no one can be certain, thats sort of the whole concept of the story and writer said that fact that no on can ever be certain is what compelled him to write it. Although the writer/director has told actors portraying Flynn on stage exclusively and perhaps Hoffman a definitive answer about his guilt or innocence, I feel like this a method of working with the actor to illicit a specific kind of performance from them. So I just wanted to share some alternative interpretations and see what you might think.

Many point to William London as the key to determining guilt regarding father Flynn molesting at the Parish/School. Near the end they cite his smirk when in church when Flynn announces his departure, and when he recoils in the begging of the film outside the school when Flynn grasps his hands. What I like about this theory is that it proves a blindspot in Sister Aloysius outlook, she clearly dislikes London very strongly. To me that says that she had it out from him and disliked him so much that it never occurred to her to humor the possibility that he could have been victimized by Flynn. Although she had an almost supernatural inclination to detect wrong doing and bad character, it wasn't indiscriminate in it's vision and her values not infallible after all. Though she likely may have suspected this when Flynn grabbed his hands near the start, but soon dismissed it, I believe in apart because she was doubtful of London being in a position of innocence for once instead of the other way around. Or even the possibility that both boys were being abused, and some have even drawn that the transistor radio boy was also being abused.

Another interpretation I have is that like Father Flynn, William London recognizes the queerness in Ronald Miller AND the queerness of father Flynn and is homophobic/sissy-phobic, or possibly racist. For the racism angle, Flynn first shows physical attention to Ronald Miller with his left hand, ""Morning champ"" seconds later he then grasps London's hand who then recoils. This could be London not wanting to be ""touched"" by Ronald's ""blackness"" It can also mean that he doesn't want to be touched by Ronald and Flynn's queerness. I went to middle and high school from 2005-2012 and encountered many boys who had this anxiety about gay boys and men touching them, and possibly turning gay from this. Since this was 1964, London may just have been straight racist and not liking the ""sissyness"" of Miller and Flynn.

Still, I think the repulsion that London shows towards Flynn throughout the film being homophobic in nature is also a possibility. The touch at the beginning, the repulsion to the long finger nails, not laughing at his joke about becoming a priest when girls show no interest in you (because he believes Flynn is not heterosexual), the smirk in response to Flynn's transfer could also show that London saw him as a threat because of his queerness. That he may eventually fall prey to Flynn or just was put off bid general demeanor. Longer finger nails are something that is considered effeminate and therefore queer. I think Flynn's description of them being long ""but it's okay because they're clean"" goes along with his progressive nature. It's a very 20th century allegory for being queer, it's abnormal but it's not harmful to be queer in the same way longer finger nails are if kept clean ie: pure intentions/consensual behavior. I think Flynn wanting to be more accepting of Ronald Miller and more inclusive sensibility goes hand in hand with this.  


I am not dismissing the possibility that Flynn was molesting London, but I think it could also mean London just didn't like him for other reasons. I do think that if he was targeting London, he would have shown less aversion. His repulsion wouldn't be as visible because I think Flynn would have needed to keep him intimidated and manipulated to keep him quiet. London's responses would have been too suggestive and I think we would have seen Flynn responding to this knowingly reacting to it as such in his facial expressions.

However, I still have my own doubts about this more sympathetic interpretation. The thing that really prevents me from whole heartedly buying into Flynn's innocence is the fact that he put a tank top in Ronald Miller's locker. If the communion wine story Flynn told is indeed true, maybe he laundered some of Miller's clothes because they were stained by the wine. That is still a very contrived sounding story and the fact that he put it in Ronald's locker just feels very damning and with William's reaction at the end it's not unreasonable to assume wrongdoing when these things are put together. Although he attempted to put the shirt in very discreetly, he didn't do it at the most convenient time, why when the kids were having gym/recess with sister James chaperoning? Perhaps if it was indicative of molestation, he would have placed it in the locker after hours or when they were in class and checked to see not witnesses could have been present to see witness it.

The sermon about ""gossip"" is clearly a response to the suspicions of Aloysius and James. What other explanation can there be for that? That doesn't make him guilty of molesting, but it does show that he was directly reacting to their suspicion itself. Or it could very well be him trying to guilt the two nuns and create a state of disbelief in the congregation. Guilty or innocent, he gave that sermon because he saw that James and Aloysius were undermining his authority and was trying to maintain his control over the community.

Thanks for coming to the end of this SUPER LONG post. I would love to hear your interpretations and even what you think of mine.",0
339,"Christmas with the coopers - a dissection. It’s Christmas I’m going through a Christmas movie phase and the worse so far is Christmas with the coopers. Why, surely the Christmas prince or something is worse? No! Because the Christmas princess stays in it’s lane. This does not. 

For those who haven’t seen Christmas with the coopers. It’s plot is an extended family has Christmas. Ground breaking. I am currently an hour in and I think the family members have sent 5 mins together and they haven’t all been in the same room together. 

The best way to explain it is the family stone meets live actually but with none of the heart or complex characters. I’m an hour in and I can barely name the characters. We’ve got grampa and the dinner girl he talks to (crushes on?) crazy old aunt, the parents who seem to be having a divorce but honestly any tension between them seems forced, crazy young aunt and the gay cop that arrested her, son and his kids and ex wife and daughter who befriend an army guy in the airport. 

There’s a lot of monologue going on and melodrama. Like no one is capable of having a normal conversion. They all give each other dying man speeches. To compare it to the likes of family stone, the dialogue in family stone feels real and natural. In Christmas with the coopers it’s all so heavily important and meaningful meaning that nothing is meaningful. We are consistently introduced to characters then we get a monalogue and the narrator announce that the character has gone through some spiritual growth. There is no actual evidence of that or any depth to the characters for is to see the need for improvement. I’m the script feel likes a drama students first attempt at writing something dramatic. 

But also let’s talk about the narration. A huge rule of story telling is show don’t tell yet consistently a narrator interrupts the story to explain the story to me. 
Boy looks out the window annoyed about x the narrator “as the boy looked out the window he realised he was annoyed by x”

Any potential subtlety in an already very heavy handed movie is lost. There is a lack of trust that the audience isn’t smart enough to understand the content which is frankly insulting. It reads like a control freak writer who wanted to ensure that the only way the film could be viewed is through that one specific lens. 

Ridiculous moments. 

1)
The grandpa and the waitress tell each other that they are “the grand piano” with no hint of irony, in the middle of a busy kitchen on Christmas Eve after gramps all the staff to stop doing what they’re doing so he can make a speech. Gramps is then transformed into his younger self (the narrator explains this to us) gramp says he has to say good bye AND THE KITCHEN STAFF CRY. One literally dabs his eyes with a tea towel. Like no. No. No.No


2)
Olivia Wilde and her fake army boyfriend do the tried and true Romcom method of stating random facts and Dee feelings about your life to strengthen connection.This has been done so well in other movies. In seeking a friend for the end of the world Steve cartel and Kiera knightly have an amazing scene where they do this and it makes me cry because you genuinely feel like they are desperately trying to get to know each other. The two movies both share the dead baby sister story line. But while Seeking a friend  is someone desperately telling someone about a meaningful experience, Christmas with the coopers just throws it out there and never addresses it. Olivia Wilde and army boy aren’t having a conversation. They are just taking it in turns to fill the silence.

3) 
The whole cop and aunt storyline. She gets him to talk about being gay. He says he wanted to be an adventurer and she says “you wanted to be an explorer and now you have a no entry sign over your heart”. Like what? If a therapist said that to me I would laugh in her face. They also drive around for literally hours. What cop has that free time?

4)
Olivia Wilde running down a hospital corridor running into every single avoidable obstacle. 

Good points. 

The parents taking about stepping back from each other. One of the dramatic conversations that actually feels realistic and authentic. Although I would argue in a better movie it would be a weaker scene. It’s one of the few conversations in this film that I feel like they are talking to each other and not at each other. However as it’s dianne Keaton and John goodman I would expect more punch and intensity. 

Army fake boyfriend - he feels more fleshed out then the other characters. 

Young Timothy chalamet playing an angsty scene

John goodman. I just love him and he sucks less than everyone in this. 

The worst points

The dialogue. - like it’s just never ever natural it’s so wordy all of the time. It just sucks. 

Family together time - for a movie that’s about a family I would expect them to spend time together. We don’t get the family fully together until 3/4 of the way through the movie.  also the addition of random guest to the Christmas table. If I turned up with a suprise guest at Christmas my mum would panic and kill a turkey with her bare hands. Dianne Keaton is so highly strung over this dinner but doesn’t bat an eyelid over waitress and army guy joining the table. 

The amount of good actors and actresses that have been dragged into this hot mess. 

The son grandpa waitress love triangle. 

Most Christmas movies aren’t a work of art and while the likes of family stone is flawed there’s still redeeming moments. This has none of that. It is a total waste of time.

347,"“The Devil All The Time” is a great example of how “The Dark Tower” should be adapted So, I’m pretty sure a lot of King fans knew that when The Dark Tower was being turned into an hour and a half movie, it wasn’t going to be good. It was pretty much doomed to fail right from the start. A lot of fans even wanted it to be turned into a tv series, which it almost was. Amazon Prime turned it down after a pilot episode was shot. For now, there’s no hope for The Dark Tower being adapted into anything yet.

But, if it was going to be a movie again, especially if they start with The Gunslinger. The Devil All The Time is probably the perfect example on how it should be adapted. 

First, runtime. The Dark Tower film was only 1hr 35min. TDATT was 2hr 19. That is a prefect runtime. The whole book of The Gunslinger could fit into that runtime, even if they make it 2hr 30min, but I’m not picky.....

Next, Directing/Writing. With what Antonio Campos did with TDATT, I believe he and his brother, Paulo, did an amazing job adapting the book. They captured the horror, heartbreak, and suspense of the story. Also with the music. It wasn’t in the movie too much, which was a great decision it really makes you take everything in as the characters are. But when the music is in, it’s really good. Even if he gets to adapt it, I think it’s a great choice. But if Mike Flanagan gets to do it😳......

Also, Cinematography. Not saying The Dark Tower film had bad cinematography, but I’m just saying that TDATT had some gorgeous cinematography that fit with the tone of the whole story. Especially since it was shot on 35mm film and with the grain. It would be a great choice for TDT since it’s a western.

Last, narration. TDATT was narrated by the author of the book, Donald Ray Pollock. Can you imagine if Stephen King himself narrated the whole movie of The Gunslinger? I think that would be amazing. It would give you so much more detail of each character, item, location and so on. It would also show just how much King put into these books to make the world feel believable and enjoyable to read.

349,"I genuinely believe there should be an Austin Powers 4 starring Idris Elba in the titular role. Hear me out, you guys… I really want to see a new Austin powers movie set in the same continuity as the previous ones staring everyone’s favorite “the next James Bond” Idris Elba. Okay so… it takes palace today, in the 2020s in a dark, gritty, and “realistic” world suspiciously similar to the world of the Craig-era Bond films. Basically, the world has lost its mojo. Dr. Evil has gone legit and is just a regular MD practicing under the name Douglas Powers. The Austin we know has gone into retirement and has become completely normal. He’s just an average, older gentleman who’s used his career earnings to start a vineyard. Austin now considers his previous “shagadelic” persona to be both outdated and even a bit embarrassing. 

Meanwhile, the British government has chosen a “new” Austin Powers played by Elba. The idea is that they are using a well-known name for their new agent in order to gain support for MI6 in a cynical era where people are becoming increasingly distrusting of authority. The new Austin Powers is presented as a suave yet brooding super spy a la Craig’s Bond. 

It turns out that Elba’s character is merely an actor with no experience thwarting dastardly plots of world domination. Thus, when Scott Evil and his army of fembots threaten to destroy the planet, the original international man of mystery must come out of retirement and save the day. Slowly but surely, he and Dr. Evil morph back into the characters we know and ""love"" over the course of the film. 

Maybe it’s a bit late for this, but I think it could be funny way to spoof the direction the Bond films (and many other franchises) have gone in the post 9/11 world. There’s even room for social commentary with all the debate around hiring Elba as the next bond. This is obviously a half-baked idea but I’d pay to see something like this for sure.

Edit: I want to note that people are suggesting just casting Elba as the actual Austin Powers and not acknowledging the change in actor and I'll admit that's a way better idea.

Edit: Okay seeing this post become popular has made me realize that this is not actually a good idea for a feature but rather one of those pre-filmed SNL sketches or something.",0
350,What’s a video game that you think might as well have been a movie or series instead? This is not asking what video games you think should get a movie adaptation. It’s about what video games you think feel very cinematic and may as well have been made as movies from the very beginning. I’d say Death Stranding is one of them. It has some very long cutscenes (The ending was literally a feature film) and the gameplay feels very cinematic as well. Could have just been a movie or maybe a series that Netflix picked up. What else would you say?,0
351,"If you are looking for a fun heist film, check out Bad Genius (On US Netflix and Prime) The other day I remembered a YouTube I watch once mentioning a heist film, but instead of them stealing money, they stealing test answers.

It took me a while to find what video he was talking about, but I finally found out it was 'Bad Genius'.

*Bad Genius* is a 2017 movie from Thailand that focuses on a kid genius who gets coaxed into helping others cheat on their tests. They push the limits further and further, until they get wrapped up in attempting an extremely elaborate and near impossible heist of stealing answers from a test in the US that is taken a few hours before those in Thailand take the exact same test.

It's a little corny at times and the couple of American actors that appear near the end are not great actors, but otherwise this movie is amazing.

It definitely seems like it was inspired by Edgar Wright's pacing, with some really witty dialogue.

*Bad Genius* is a joy from start to finish and is up there as one of the best movies I've seen this year. One of my all time favorite movies is Soderbergh's *Ocean's 11* and this really scratched that itch.",0

As a devout cinephile I've found that one of the greatest treats I can enjoy is going into a movie knowing next to nothing about it and being blown away by it. So often we're exposed to trailers or promo shots or word of mouth but every once in a while we get to experience a movie as a real surprise, and it's an absolute delight. Almost a decade ago I went out with some friends to see a movie. They didn't tell me which one, and I didn't think to ask. It wasn't until we were in the theater and I found out it was Woody Allen's *Midnight in Paris*, which I uncharacteristically didn't know about. Boy, was it great. The way the plot unfolded, the historical references, the music, the nostalgia element. It was truly one of the greatest experiences I've ever had at the movies.

360,"Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, Before Midnight. *spoilers* I finished watching all the movies and I always like movies like these, low-key with a lot of banter, just 2 people talking. 

One thing that stuck out to me: in Before Sunset, the 2 remember that night in Before Sunrise and agree that they had sex (twice in fact as Celine puts it)

But... they didn't have sex in Before Sunrise. That was the whole point, Celine tells ethan hawke that she doesn't want to be just another pick-up story about a girl he meets in europe and fucks. He's disappointed but happy just to spend the night with her. 

So... was this just an example of how people tend to romanticize memories and how memories morph over time or... ? I went back to rewatch the last scenes in Before Sunrise just to check that point again. Just wondering what people thought. 

Before Midnight was... depressing. Not just the fight scene, but all the stuff leading up to it. I mean, is there any resolution to how ethan hawke uses celine in his books, and she resents him for it? She was clearly uncomfortable with signing the book in the hotel lobby, and in the heat of the argument she tells him never to use her or their girls in his books ever. And at the end, what's it supposed to imply? That they made up? She goes along with his story and is convinced after he tells her he won't come back if she gives up on their relationship now?

367,"(Unpopular Film Opinion?) I prefer watching older films with original film grain, rather than the HD re-releases (visuals only, not audio) I prefer the original grainy visuals of older movies (70's-80's etc.) rather than the remastered HD releases.

Is it just me, or do you guys prefer the original quality (visually) of older movies too? I'm sure there are exceptions but for some reason I like watching a film like Texas Chainsaw, El Mariachi, or The Goonies with the original film grain.

Please don't get me wrong, this is only about the visual film grain. I think I prefer the updated audio of remasters and re-releases.

As an example, I really enjoy the film 28 Days Later, and because of the way the film was shot (Canon XL1 or something similar), I don't think there's a way to create a 4k re-release of the film. That being said, I often wonder how that movie would look with all the new bells and whistles.

I always come to the same conclusion; I'd love a version of 28 Days Later that was a littler better visually like regular Standard-Definition ( I think the movie is sub 480p? don't quote me on that.). But I think the lower quality visuals add to the atmosphere of the film, and an HD-4K re-release would take away some of the charm (if you can call it that in a film like 28 Days Later.)

I haven't thought about it much, but off the top of my head I'd think that movies in the 90's maybe didn't have all that much grain at least from what I can remember growing up.

Are there others like me? Am I one? Are we many? Are we Legion?

TL;DR: I prefer original film grain on older movies rather than the HD visuals of some older movies (Not All)",0

The symbolism used in the movie, the way each main character is a ""prisoner"" in his own external/internal prison , the ambiguous ending all blew me away. 

The scene towards the end where Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) drives to the hospital with Anna struggling for life is THE most intense scene I've ever watched and I believe that scene is what I'm going to remember this movie by. 

But I still have one question about the end of the movie - Why did the psycho aunt decide to inject Anna with LSD even though Loki was knocking on the door? I'm assuming she heard the knock because

1. She pauses and looks when Loki's car enters the driveway. Or, this can also be interpreted as her hearing Anna move around in the other room, having partly regained consciousness. 

2. Loki hears the floorboard creak when the aunt is injecting LSD into Anna's veins. So, the room where Anna is in must be close to the door and the aunt should've heard the knock, right? 

If she would have answered the door, Loki would have told her about Alex and just walked off without any suspicion and Anna/Keller Dover(Hugh Jackman) would likely never have been found.",0

400,"What are some examples of big budget oddities? Films that had a budget far higher than you’d expect them to Three examples off the top of my head:

Outlander (2008) - A human from outer space has to team up with Vikings to defeat an alien monster that he’s accidentally brought to Earth. That description doesn’t do it justice, it’s an amazing film. With that story you’d expect it to be a small budget syfy affair, but the unexpectedly big budget brings with it big name actors like John Hurt and Ron Perlman - who give great performances - and special effects that still look amazing today. Seeing the main character slowly learn Viking culture and gain their trust brings a great human element to an already really cool monster film.

Virus (1999) - Jamie Lee Curtis is part of a salvage crew who find a Russian navy ship adrift in the ocean. They board it, not knowing that an energy based alien life form has taken over the ship. The story on this is a bit here and there, but the effects that the budget affords are something else. Super creepy atmosphere, amazing practical effects, it’s like the borg from Star Trek made extra terrifying. There aren’t too many horror films set at sea and this is one I’d recommend.

The Island (1980) - Michael Caine is a journalist investigating ships disappearing at sea, not knowing that a band of inbred pirates who’ve survived since the 1700s are the cause. I’m not sure I can as readily recommend this one, but it’s a sight to behold. You spend the whole time wondering ‘how the hell did a film with this script get this kind of budget?’ The story’s all over the place, but Michael Caine puts in an entertaining performance and the set pieces showing the pirate attacks are very well done. This is the most oddity one on my list and for the what the hell experience alone it’s pretty worth it.",0

Anyway, as much as a story is important to a film, the cinematography and visual feel is obviously very important; I'm only just starting to get back into appreciating movies after a long time going through binge-watching series. I've wanted to, but had a fair few series on my tick list to see.

Whose visual styles and esthetics have you really enjoyed watching?

For me, Quentin Tarantino's have long been a favorite, especially *Kill Bill* with its retro feel and influences from westerns, martial arts, pop-culture and action-girls - it took me 15 years to *really* appreciate it *(I only really watched it for the action, not the story, to be honest; well, when I first saw it anyway, not so much now)*, and also *Inglourious Basterds* *(still a favorite of mine from the 2000s that I'll watch in re-runs; Diane Kruger excels as Bridget von Hammersmark and one of the sexiest film characters despite her switching sides and being an anti-hero; Brad Pitt as Raine though, great!)*; not always into WWII films, but this one was one I enjoyed. 

I've not yet seen *Four Rooms*, but it was out 25 years ago; worth seeing or not?

*Sin City* is probably one of my favorite Tarantino movies; I loved the gritty noir feel and black-and-white filming effect being used. Bruce Willis as John Hartigan was one I enjoyed for the action when I saw this film. Anyhow... giving this one a rewatch.

What I like about Tarantino is his mix of influences gel together and somehow just work... no idea how but they do.

This is just one example, but I'm also a fan of John Hughes' films - some of them, but that's outside this timeframe.

I limited it to just the past decade and the 2000s so that there's not a large timeframe to go through.

Will be interesting to see your responses.

Also, are you going to do any rewatches, out of interest, like I am with Quentin Tarantino films?",0

404,"One of the best American Actresses from the 1950s and 60s: Natalie Wood Appreciation Thread For me, Natalie Wood was just remarkable. She wasn't just a pretty face, she also could act her heart out in challenging roles like in Splendor in the Grass and Inside Daisy Clover. She managed to cross over from child actress to a grown up, she became a sex-symbol, a star, a respected actress with multiple Academy Award nominations and a tragic death at a young age that is still talked about to this day. 

I love her work in the 1960s and I wish she hadn't allowed married life to have her distance herself from acting for so long since it hurt her in the long run. By the time, she went back to work, all she had were TV movies and mini-series.",0

410,"What happened with Michael Bay's Transformers? The first Bayformers movie came out in 2007 and my mom took me to watch it. I was 11 years old when it came out so the movie had everything I could ever ask for from an IP I was a sort of a fan of: nice cars, non-stop action, Shia LaBeouf as a actor I knew (Holes, Even Stevens etc), and Megan Fox in her prime and to this day is still is one of my favorite theater experiences ever. This movie isn't perfect by any means but its incredibly entertaining and fun to watch. I own this movie on DVD because I loved it that much. I have owned 2 Camaros because of this movie lol.


Revenge of the Fallen came out 2 years later in 2009 and I was really hyped to watch it cause I couldn't get enough of Transformers. My older brother this time took me to watch it and I remember about halfways through the movie, when they meet the SR-71 Blackbird Decepticon, I remember thinking to myself in that moment ""This movie is really stupid and nowhere near as good as the first one."" I watched the first Bayformers so much that I noticed that Michael Bay uses stock-footage from the first one of the UAV Drone flying through the desert and I noticed that right off the bat and even told my brother right there in the theater. This movie was incredibly disappointing and ruined any hope I had for future movies.


Dark of the Moon was the next one but at this time I had no interest in watching it at all. I eventually rented it through my cable provider but I have no re-collection of anything that happens in this movie and I'm in no rush to watch it again. I do remember my friends saying it was better than Revenge of the Fallen but that didn't get me to rush to a theater to see it.


I gave Age of Extinction a chance when it came out because I thought ""Okay, maybe *this* movie can be a fun movie like the first. There's new actors and characters so I'll give it a chance"" and maaaaaan, this movie is 2 hours and a half long but feels like 6 hours. I finally gave up at this movie with Bayformers.


What happened with this franchise? How come Michael Bay couldn't capture the fun, entertaining, and great action scenes the first one had with the rest? I've been wondering if anyone else feels the same with these movies.",0
411,"Looking for info on Detective Dee Series Just recently rewatched the **Detective Dee trilogy**

Directed by **Tsui Hark**

**Young Detective Dee: Rise of the Sea Dragon (2013)**

**Detective Dee: The Four Heavenly Kings (2018)**

**Detective Dee: The Mystery of the Phantom Flame (2010)**

I loved all three movies, and am most particular to **Rise of the Sea Dragon**. But all three are great action/adventure/fantasy/mystery.

Just wondering if anyone on here has any information on the next future movies.

Can't seem to really find any information about them on google.

IMDb has two more slated but doesn't give much else information :

[Detective Dee: Solitary Skies Killer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12763774/?ref_=tt_sims_tti) : says released in China on 07/19/2020

&

[Detective Dee: Deep Sea Palace](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt12794300/?ref_=tt_sims_tti) : says released in China on 02/21/2020

Neither seem to be directed by Hark nor do they seem to feature the same actors.

So are they connected to the trilogy at all? Or are they unrelated stories of the same character?

Also when will it make it to the US??

Just curious if anyone has any information as I love the stories of Di Renjie and would love for the story to continue as it seems like it was left open ended with the intention of more sequels.",0

413,"Idris Elba. Hollywood keeps trying to jumpstart him as a movie star but it hasn't exactly worked. Why is that?  We know he has range. Anyone watching The Wire or Luther can see that. Over a decade ago or so ago he was in things like American Gangster and Daddy's Little Girls and Rock n Rolla but nothing came of it. He got a supporting role in the Thor trilogy while he got sizable roles in films like Pacific Rim and Prometheus. Unfortunately, he didn't put butts into the seat.

Beasts of No Nation was great but the Academy ignored it. Films like No Good Deed failed to galvanize his fanbase. The less said about Bastille Day or The Dark Tower or The Mountain Between Us, the better. These were all ample opportunities for him to solidify if he was bankable or not.

But everything he has done since then has been a sliding scale of pretentious bullshit. 

*Rushmore* was a somewhat interesting story that was marred by Wes' irritating need to turn everything into an art deco diorama. 

Then there was *The Royal Tenenbaums*, which I found barely watchable. I get it Wes. Depression and your favorite records matched with a bunch of pretentious artsy shots.

Then there was *A Life Aquatic.* I didn't make it fifteen minutes into the movie. It's like a teenager had an unlimited budget for his high school play.

426,"Does anyone feel that any time two men are close there is speculation of a gay subtext? I feel that any time there are two men who have a close relationship in a movie someone mentions that there is talk of a gay relationship, even if there is no explicit mention of it whatsoever. I have seen this recently in two Hitchcock movies, The Lady Vanishes and Rope. I understand that due to social mores, this may have been suppressed in the past, but it seems to crop up unusually often, and without justification. IMO if someone is going to bring this up there should be a justification other than simply two men being close in the plot. Sometimes there are other reasons to have two men being close, such as a humorous couple where one plays the straight guy to the other's joker. Why can't men just be friends?",0

438,"In Kill Bill, Hattori Hanzo and Pai Mei are meant to represent polar opposites as a good and a evil teacher respectively. An aspect from the Kill Bill I don't often see discussed is how each of the two volumes introduces us to a Martial Arts master of Bill, and how each holds completely different views on their apprentice. Both these teachers are directly inspired by very different legendary figures for Martial Arts, with vastly different personalities.

In Volume I we are introduced to the legendary Hattori Hanzo (played by famous martial artist japanese actor Sonny Chiba). The name is itself borrowed from a famous ninja and samurai from the Tokugawa period, famous for his hability and loyalty. Throughout history there have been at least 5 famous Hattori Hanzo's from that family. If the Hanzo from the movie is a descendant, it is not known.

In the movie, Hanzo taught Bill how to be a master swordsman, and, while we never see Bill at his full potential, I think we can judge his skills at least partially from what we see in Beatrix, since she learned from him. Besides being a great (the greatest?) swordsman, Hanzo is a master swordsmith and forges several for his pupil.

By the time we meet Hanzo in Volume I he is retired and deeply shamed by his past. **The fact that his apprentice, Bill, has used his teachings for hired killing torment him considerably.** Enough to make him swear a vows never to make a blade again, and then break it to forge for Beatrix the weapon she will need to kill his former apprentice. Here we see a classic trope of the tortured and disgraced samurai. This is famous in Japanese movies, being utilized by directors such  as Kurosawa, and latter migrating to american movies through the japanese influence in westerners. Look at the conflicted tortured Cowboy, who wants to make ammends for his past.

**Hanzo is honorable and cerimonial, a good teacher and master who expects to see his teachings carried out in a honorable fashion.**

Then we have Pai Mei. Himself a legendary figure in Chinese martial arts, Pai Mei (Bak Mei) is said to have been one of the 5 legendary elders who survived the massacre and destruction of the Shaolin (yes that one) Temple in the 17th century. According to legend, Pai Mei betrayed the monks and aided in its destruction. He was a Taoist monk himself, and master of his own style. Pai Mei is very popular in chinese martial arts movies and is almost always portrayed as the proud and skilled villanous Kung fu master.

In Volume II we are introduced to Pai Mei (played by famous martial artist chinese actor Gordon Liu, who in the past played the enemy of Pai Mei in multiple movies such as Fists of the White Lotus). He is a famous (possibly ancient, we do not know) Kung Fu master who taught Bill his kung fu techniques. He is known for his cruelty and pride, and Bill openly tells Beatrix about how Pai Mei slaughtered the entire Shaolin Temple out of spite. Throughout the movie we see that he is indeed cruel, proud and filled with contempt. He hates Japanese, hates women, is easly offended and retaliates with absolute violence. **He does not care that Bill is a killer, and, in fact, the only reason he trains Beatrix is because Bill asks him to do it.** Pai Mei does not have any regrets and, throughout his chapter in the movie, shows that strength is the only thing he really respects.  I would go so far as to say that he is proud of his former apprentice.

In Kill Bill he fits perfectly with the same antagonists from the chinese Martial Arts movies. The difference is that our protagonist is not his opponent, but his pupil.

**Pai Mei is a cruel and ruthless master that cares only for martial arts, regardless of what people do with these martial skills.**

In conclusion, they are both masters of their own dominion. One a swordsman, the other a Kung Fu warrior. One is good, the other is not. Both are straight up taken from history, and are parts of established cinema tropes, from Japanese and Western movies to Chinese Kung Fu cinema.

TL:DR - Hattori Hanzo and Pai Mei are legendary figures, one a honorable swordsman and the other a cruel Kung Fu master. Both taught Bill, but represent very different sides of combat, as the former regrets Bill's mercenary life, and the latter is indifferent to it, carying only for skill. They are also very established movie tropes of the tortured and disgraced samurai in Japanese movies for Hanzo, and the evil Kung Fu Master for Pai Mei.",0

I first heard about it on [Half in the Bag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPqYOImouvk), and despite looking insanely weird, I decided to give it a shot and was immediately hooked.  
The glamor of old Hollywood is an important ascetic choice, as the themes revolve around the pop-culture icon worship that has been a structural part of our social DNA since the invention of the camera.  
The score was one of the things that stood out to me as a brilliant blend of classic film noir and modern pop songs from the 60's to the 90's.  
On the surface, the story is simple: Man meets girl. Girl disappears. Man looks for girl.

So I think this is quite common trope in animation, you could have some example in the demon in Disenchantment series. But I wonder if there was done something simmilar in live action.

448,"Why does Andy Muschietti get given so many projects? I mean if you go on the guys wikipedia, its just a laundry list of unrealised projects that are supposedly all still in the works, but I just find it interesting that he gets offered so many directing gigs off the back of not that many movies.

He was previously in the running to direct The Mummy reboot (bullet dodged tbh), Bird Box, He-Man and The Snow White and the Huntsman sequel. He was also attached to direct an Electric State adaptation but I guess the Russo Brothers are doing that now.

He is also apparently still attached to adapt Robotech, Stephen King's the Jaunt, as well as live action adaptations of Dracul, Shadow of the Colossus and Attack on Titan.

There's also a Howling remake for Netflix, and he's obviously directing The Flash Movie for DC.

Does he have a particular style? I mean he mostly does horror, so does that make him suited for all these other projects? I mean James Wan made the jump fairly seamlessly, maybe he's good at pitching?

I mean I'm familiar with directors making a splash with a project and from that they get offered lots of properties. I thought Mama was fine (the short its based off of is probably scarier though) and the first It was enjoyable, wasn't a huge fan of the second one tbh.

Is it really just his success with what he's already done? Is he efficient and good at getting a job done? Does he have a fantastic agent? What do you guys think of him?",0
449,"The Perfect MOVIE THEATER Movie Hey r/movies, my sweetheart of a girlfriend rented us a private movie showing for an evening over the holidays so we could watch ANY one movie we want (and not have to worry about COVID). 

I just need YOUR help in choosing the perfect movie for the best movie theater experience. 

Just a few criteria:

We have a 2h30min time limit and I'd rather get a movie closer to that length, than to 90 minutes to get our money's worth. 

I think I would also be partial to an Action, Thriller, or scary since I find those more enjoyable for a theater experience, as opposed to comedies and dramas.

455,"What's a small, ""easy to miss"" moment from a movie that no one really talks about, but you've been dying to discuss? So many times there are discussion threads about favourite bits from movies that are big moments- massive action scenes or long, dramatic monologues. Those are great and all, but I absolutely love it when a movie has a small quick moment or line that just sticks with you, often inexplicably. Often times there isn't really any discussion or shared appreciation for them.

Here are a few of mine- moments I absolutely love that can really be explained, and I wish I could discuss them more:


* [This moment In Tropic Thunder where I assume Robert Downey Jr. is about to break character. At 1:47.](https://youtu.be/mCDoD3yIXJM?t=104) I have no idea why they didn't use a different take or if it was an intentional choice. .
* [Adam Scott's weird laugh during Brennan's song in step brothers. At 2:20.](https://youtu.be/ZR6Z6q8RjBs?t=140) Absolutely slays me, probably my favourite moment in the movie..
* [""Have a nice trip, see you next fall"". At 0:36.](https://youtu.be/OOS79yMJqtc?t=36) While my other examples are just funny moments from comedies, this one has driven me mad. I have spent an inordinate amount of time trying to figure this line out. Wtf does the cop mean by that? It almost sounds like a pun someone would say if one of the criminals fell over or something, but it makes absolutely no sense. Is it supposed to imply that the cop is jaded and expects to see these criminals on the street shortly in the future? That doesn't really make sense in the context of the triumphant nature of the scene though. Seriously, what does it mean?!?",0

457,"Political dramas about governing from the POV of the politician Something like Oliver Stone's **W.**, minus the biographical aspects. Something not too flashy, but featuring scenes around specific policy proposals and their ramifications, as the protagonist whips up votes and ultimately succeeds or fails. Like if Michael Clayton were a president or a senator. I think **Lincoln** may fit the bill too, but it's been a long time since I've seen it.

**Game Change**, **Recount**, **The Ides of March**, and **The War Room** (although a documentary) are *close*, but I'm not looking for films about an election, per se. The scene I have in mind is the one in W. where Bush is with his advisors in the Oval Office trying to figure out a justification for the Iraq War. **House of Cards** does this well, too, but it's too exaggerated/fantastical, and also not a film.

462,"If you can't hear some of the dialogue in Tenet, then the movie gives the opposite impression than it's supposed to *Spoilers in spoiler tags* This movie relies on a connection to the main character of this film. If you cannot hear some of the dialogue, then you have none. I have a few specific scenes to point out here.

Sequence in the first 5 min:

>!He and his team are dressed as SWAT members. !<

>!He starts messing with a bomb pulling it out of another SWAT member's bag. !<

>!The SWAT member gets made and starts firing at him. This initially makes me think, ""huh, is he trying to set bombs and the SWAT team is trying to stop him or vice versa?"" !<

>!Cut to some dialogue in a back room. Can't hear what they saying. Something about blowing up the cheap seats. !<

>!Goes and starts checking the bombs. I guess it's to make sure they are working. !<

>!He throws one of the bombs into the top stands. I guess he wants more than the poor people dead now.!<

>!He's an evil motherfucker. Or is he just a completely amoral CIA agent who was trying to get rid of witnesses? I guess I will watch the rest of the movie to find out. One thing is for sure though. He doesn't give a fuck about people's lives!<

>!To be clear, I read the script for that scene. I read the dialogue which shows that it's actually the opposite of what I saw on screen. He wants to save the people in the cheap seats. He is trying to make sure people don't die. !<

If you have seen all of Tenet, you might be asking, >!""well what about when he says to Robert Pattinson that he doesn't want extra people to die on the plane?""!<

>!Well, I thought he was a lying psychopath. It's already established at this point that he not only wants to kill a whole theater of people, but that he sees objects in rooms as a way to brutalize people (like cheesegraters on people's face). I guess he wants Robert Pattinson to think he has a conscience. No idea why. Seems like standard CIA procedure to lie about stuff to each other though.!<

>!""Well,"" you might say, ""what about him saving the world? Didn't that give away the fact that he was a good guy?""!<

>!I will admit, that was a little confusing. However, I just assumed he was a man on a mission. Nothing would stop him. Nothing would prevent him from breaking hearts and killing everyone in his way either.!<

Spoiler for Tenet ending:

>!The whole damn movie I just wanted him to get what he deserved. A slow and painful death. Instead, there's an emotional scene with his friend. Since it is firmly established that they have been friends for years, then I can only assume that Robert Pattinson is an evil motherfucker too. Just one motherfucker reminiscing about their previous evil rampages together, the other sad that he doesn't remember those rampages with his friend. !<

>!Fuck that ending! Robert Pattinson shouldn't have been his friend! It should've had John David Washington save the world, then Robert blowing his brains out!!<

>!Last scene shows the Protagonist shooting a dude in the head. At least there is a good reason to kill that guy?!<

>!Fuck this movie.!<

463,"Re-watching ""London Has Fallen""- American god complex, should be called a comedy. This is just going to focus on the most publicised scene of the film, London being attacked. So this starts off with the US President arriving in London; three helicopters landing in the court of Somerset House. The President has A LOT of protection as expected; escorted by a convoy of vehicles. Then you are shown the Canadian Prime Minister also protected and in a similar vehicle. But then we are shown multiple other World leaders and get this, the Japanese Prime Minister is stuck in traffic with ONE bodyguard/driver. The French Prime Minister is on a small boat with maximum 3 Bodyguards, not a yacht or anything just a small open, unprotected and vulnerable boat. The Italian Prime Minister is completely unprotected and extremely vulnerable, not a bodygaurd in sight. To finish it off the German Prime Minister is protected by two to three Bodyguards, who in the event of an attack are all killed straight away. The worst part in all of this is how insanely unsecure they make the authorities in London seem. How in the Jesus Christ did all the police on the scene, all the queens guard outside Buckingham Palace (about 10 of them) and a paramedic turn out to all be terrorists. How does that happen? Is London so unsecured that people that aren't police officers can just drive around in replica vehicles and disguises, to ""protect"" a high security event with multiple with World leaders attending without anyone thinking ""Hey where did all these random people come from? I dont recognise a single officer here."" If these people weren't actually recruited by the police force, then wouldn't there be a group of people that were actually meant to be securing the event? If so what happened to them? Were they all killed? Did they take the day off? And for christ sake the Queen's guard were ALL fake, how? Tell me how that can happen? It just seems completely absurd to the point I struggle to be angry and instead find humour in this stupidity.

 This really shows you how the majority of American people feel like they're the center of the world. The fact their President is the only adequately protected Leader is absurd, it makes the other leaders seem less important and more like just CEO's of a large company. I think it also shows that American's feel that because they are a superpower, no one else can do what they do, it always has to be a less boisterous display, while what they do has to be more particular and exceptional. This links back to how I said the film should be called a comedy, the Americans take themselves so seriously it just invites laughter. 
The rest of the movie is the President's bodyguard being a borderline psychopath and some extremely cheesey patriotism. Terrible film in my opinon.

Do not take any criticism towards ""Americans"" personal, im just referring to the American people behind the creation of the film, who are obviously seriously oblivious to the existence of security in the rest of the world.",0

471,"Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans Ending WTF Theories Let me say that this movie is great. Very underrated in my book. I don't get the low rating on iMDB. It is not a remake as many think, in fact Werner Herzog did not even wacth the Abel Ferrara's version. So this is like a totally different adaptation and with a totally different tone.

The insane performance of Nic Cage, the iguana or the dancing soul are great inclusiones and worked spectacular, I have even enjoyed this film more than Abel Ferrara's version. Perhaps because I too have suffered and suffer from addiction problems. 

But if there is something that intrigues and bothers me, it is the last 15 minutes of the movies, it's like a GIANT WTF!?. What the fuck is going on there? Magically the protagonist's girlfriend quit the drugs and the Cage's stepmother stop drinking and they are like the ideal family, but the lead character (Cage) continues to use drugs alone and when he is snorting heroin (?) alone in a hotel room meets the guy he saved at the beginning of the film and the final shot is of both sitting in front of a large aquarium where Nic Cage's character says to the guy ""Do fish have dreams?"". Then credits. 

I don't know how to interpret these last 15 minutes, is it a literal ending, with Nic Cage who cannot escape his addiction or is it all a dreamlike representation of some imagination of the character of Nic Cage? A review analyzed the last 15 minutes and said that they belonged to a hallucination of Nicholas Cage who suffers an overdose of heroin / cocaine (it is mentioned in the film that the drug that he seizes is of high purity and if the wrong dose was taken, OD is highly possibly). 

What are your theories? Also, which version do you prefer, being so different, Bad Lieutenant by Abel Ferrara or Werner Herzog's Bad Lieutenant Port of Call New Orleans?",0

476,"Would Red Dawn have gotten a PG-13 rating today? (spoilers) Something I've been pondering. It was the first PG-13 movie, which at the time was thought of as just a rating for the ""higher"" end of PG. But honestly had it been released prior I could see it getting an R, and maybe even today. It's commonly thought of as a ""dumb"" movie, which is probably because the premise is so absurd (obviously). But once you get past that....it's a pretty chilling film. It actually addresses the full implications of child soldiers and shows what would happen pretty accurately with the psychological damage in addition to having to deal with their own families being killed, while the violence may not be that graphic in comparison to horror films or some of the more graphic Arnold Schwarzenegger films of the era it's still way bloodier than today's superhero PG-13 action flicks, it shows underage minors executing one of their also underage friends...

So yeah, thoughts? I honestly think this would've gotten an R rating today if filmed as is. (I know there was some probably awful remake a couple years back that I never saw, but I assume it probably wasn't comparable in terms of content, especially as it had the even more laughable premise of North Korea invading the mainland US.)",0

501,"Interview with the Vampire - Tom Cruise at his best when playing bad guys. Neil Jordan brings eerie atmosphere. Not scary but worth watching. I'm not even a huge fan of Tom Cruise but I must say I loved his role as bisexual, psychopathic and raging bitch vampire Lestat. Cruise took a huge risk at playing this role and he pulled it off. This was a reminder of how talented an actor he is when he plays against type. I love how Lestat is such a control freak, who takes delight in having Louis and Claudia under his rule. He can be gentle and kind but also a catty bitch and a monster. 

I love the mood Neil Jordan brings. Brad Pitt gets tiring with the constant brooding but he's just there too look cute and sexy. Kirsten Dunst is incredible, exceptional and very difficult performance. 

I didn't find the movie to be scary per se, it's no Company of Wolves, but I was engaged by it. It feels like a Gothic fairy-tale for adults who don't like Horror.",0

503,"What's a scene for you where the dialogue and general action felt clunky and forced even if the rest of the film was good? Doesn't matter what the franchise, what film, as long as it's one you found good or the critics thought was good.

I'd be interested to see what *you* thought would fit the title above; I'm sure there's some scenes where you thought ""It's painful to watch this scene... is it here to fill time and feels a bit forced, doesn't fit in with the story or is just a bit too fanservice-y?"".

What particular scenes in any film qualified as this for you, be it live-action, animated, anime, any movie, any genre?",0
504,"The best decades for movies (as per average IMDb ratings) I'm sure something like this has been done before, but out of boredom I took the [IMDb top 250](https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/), chucked it into a spreadsheet and worked out the numbers of movies in the list per decade. Here's what it looks like.


Decade  |  # of movies   |   Average rating

1920s |	6	|               8.12

1930s |	6	 |              8.25

1940s |	11	  |             8.24

1950s |	23	   |            8.23

1960s |	18	    |           8.26

1970s |	19	     |          8.29

1980s |	30	      |         8.22

1990s |	39	       |        8.38

2000s |	47	        |       8.27

2010s |	51	         |      8.18

The 1990s takes top spot with 8.38. which is probably consistent with my own opinion.

The 2010s is ranked second-lowest, with only the 1920's behind it.

However, an interesting phenomenon is that every year more and more movies seem to be made that wind up with ""top 25-worthy"" ratings. I'm not entirely sure if this is just a matter of recency bias, because the progression is so steady throughout a period of 100 years. The only anomaly is the 1950s, which had more ""good"" movies than either the 40's before it or the 60's after it (I concur- the 50s was a good era for movies, whereas the 60's seemed to have a bit of an identity crisis after TV became widespread).",0

510,"Craig Mazin really turned his career around did he? So last year, I watched the HBO miniseries Chernobyl and it was excellent. Now at the time, while I did see that Craig Mazin wrote and directed the series, I never did look at his past work. Even after Chernobyl won a bunch of awards and it was announced that Mazin would helm The Last of Us series, I still didn't look him up on IMDB. 

Recently, I made a post about whether or not David S. Goyer was a good screenwriter/director and somebody brought up Craig Mazin. I recognized the name and did a Wikipedia search and was shocked to see his past work. 

Here are some of the movies Craig Mazin has written in the past:

* RocketMan (1997)
* Scary Movie 3 (2003)
* Scary Movie 4 (2006)
* Superhero Movie (2008)
* The Hangover Part II (2011)
* The Hangover Part III (2013)

How did Mazin go from writing a bunch of low-brow comedies to making one of the most acclaimed miniseries of the 2010s? It just blows my mind. It's like when Peter Farrelly of the Farrelly Brothers made Green Book after doing Dumb & Dumber and Movie 43. How does that make any sense? What's next? Uwe Boll winning an Academy Award?",0

514,"Noah Baumbach’s Frances Ha, love, lukewarm or loathe? Now, look, before certain people here burn me at the stake, I want it to be made known that I did quite like this film, it’s good...but it’s just that and only that, ‘Good’.

I thought that the screenplay was absolutely excellent, which I expected considering that Noah Baumbach and Greta Gerwig, two genuinely amazing writers, wrote this and I thought the cinematography was excellent but that was about all I loved about the film. (And that wonderful ‘Modern Love’ sequence of course.)

The rest of the film just seemed...ok, alright. I’ve heard constant praise about Greta Gerwig’s performance but I really found her to be quite average in this movie, which I know is quite the unpopular opinion but I just feel like her performance is anything special.

So, my question is, I guess, do you feel it gets a little bit more attention than it actually deserves? I’m interested in hearing all different sides of this argument as I have seen a lot of, practically constant, positive reviews of this film but I’ve also seen a handful of neutral or negative ones. 

By the way, I’m really not looking for a back and forth shouting match here, I’d watch Baumbach’s Marriage Story if I was looking for that, I just want a friendly discussion about a film that I was sort of lukewarm on that I’m interested in hearing other people’s takes on.",0

516,"Ironic production processes that undermines a film's message or intent? One angle that I think is interesting to consider in the art vs the artist debate is the process by which the art in question is made.   


For example, the film Doubt with Meryl Streep, Amy Adams and Phillip Seymour Hoffman about a woman challenging a patriarchal organization to bring down an alleged sexual predator was financed by Miramax which was originally owned by Harvey Weinstein. By the time it was being filmed, they had long sold Miramax to Disney so Weinstein did not have a direct executive influence over the project or so it seems. But let's assume he did for the sake of argument. 

What if Doubt's production or it's promotion hired interns that were then exploited by Weinstein in a nature resembling the allegations in the film itself? I'm assuming this was par for the course and a perk to the abusers hiring the interns for every production where this happened.   


So I know I used a heavy subject matter example, but a similar irony I see in say a film that tells the audience to believe in miracles like Santa Claus yet relies on extensive visual effects to create what isn't there. Or a film about how disabled or trans people face discrimination and are subjugated but doesn't employ any actors of those identities. Think also a film like Hook which has a ""dad you work too much"" message but maybe the writer or director spends 300 days a year away from their kids and is kind of reluctant to raise their kids when with them and is eager to be away.  


I think separating the art from the artist or even the artistic process is much more complicating in film than say fiction writing, since film involves literally hundreds and thousands of people rather than one in order to be crafted. While I definitely prioritize the safety and wellbeing of others than giving a proven abusive filmmaker another chance to make art again (who may use that as an opportunity to abuse more people in the process, or use the revenue from ticket sales to fund a silencing campaign/defense fund/intimidation tactics) I do think it's unfortunate that actors, set designers, costumers, gaffers, and other crews acting in good conscious hard work is sort of lost or discounted when an abusers is outed.  


What are your thoughts? Is there a film that just seems like hypocritical bullshit because of what was going on behind the scenes? And yeah it doesn't have to be so extreme of circumstances like violent assault or harassment. Perhaps just something where how the film was made is opposite of the films message.",0

December 18, 2020 is Secondhand Lions - 2003. 

[Trailer/Watch link.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkZnTigJcNU)

The basic premise: 14-year-old Walter is left by his irresponsible mother, Mae, to live for the summer with his reclusive, bachelor great-uncles, Hub and Garth.

It's a very enduring story about growing up in unexpected places with unexpected people and how much they can impact your lives.

I first saw Secondhand Lions in the theater when it came out on September 19th, 2003 and it's stuck with me ever since. Haley Joel Osment is perfectly cast as Walter because he's on the cusp of maturity and you can hear his voice cracking as he delivers lines. His voice is also noticeably deeper at the end of the film.

Robert Duvall gives a wonderful speech in the middle of the film about believing in things and then there's also Duvall's ""loved only one woman"" one-liner that will leave you smiling.

[Where you can watch it online.](https://www.justwatch.com/us/search?q=Secondhand%20Lions)

Trivia: Berkeley Breathed the artist of Bloom County drew the cartoons seen on the adult Walter's desk.

521,"Littering in US Films Nowadays, we notice how strange smoking is on old tv shows -- I am not sure if you can even watch old tv shows that depict smoking (or maybe they have to be broadcast after 8 pm).

I am rewatching 12 Angry Men from 1957 and one character casually throws a gum wrapper through the court house window in the room in which the jurors are about to confer. This is quite noticeable. I well recall when the streets (and especially highways) almost looked like garbage dumps -- just unspeakable what we used to do to our country.

It was Lady Bird Johnson who began an antilittering campaign and it made a big difference. I can't recall the last time I saw anyone litter. I assume that just as depicting smoking in films and TV was limited in the late 1960s (remember also how common cig ads were on tv? -- how strange it would be to see a pro-smoking ad and I even find vaping commercials strange and I think they have stopped those now also.)

525,"What Disney Princess movies would you like to see? Disney has somewhat tried to be more diverse in recent years and I was thinking some of the parts of the world they haven’t done Princess movies inspired by yet I’d like to see

- **Japan**: With anime getting bigger and bigger with western audiences I could see Disney trying to capitalise on it with their own “take.” I’d love a classic 2D Disney but I can live with 3D Disney animation too. As anime is also big in China and they want Chinese BO all the time too I can see them being perhaps a bit more “anime” I.e. a little more out there than their usual fare. But this is Disney so it’d never stray too far. I love the musicals but I’d be fine with a non musical for this, and get some great fight choreography in there. Hell go full Naruto with it hire whoever choreographs their fights (A Naruto + Sasuke vs Momoshiki level fight in a Disney film? Yes please) and have Yasuharu Takanashi do the OST. Yes I’m going full weeb here

- **Inuit**: With Avatar the last Airbender having a revival of sorts with Netflix and that live action show I was thinking I’d love to see a movie based on Inuit mythos. Basically Disney trying to make their own Katara, I would not complain about it. Also the idea of animated Northern Lights sounds so pretty in my head

- **Aborigine Australia**: I feel this is maybe the least likely of all but again one I’d be one of the most interested in. Also cos been listening to Triple Bi Pass podcast and they always start it with a statement about how the Aborigine land was stolen and I always like that they acknowledge that

- **Native American**: Yes we have Pocahontas but we all know how badly that’s aged. So I say give it another go with a different story there’s plenty out there. And actually commit with the casting too for all the talk of diversity and representation in Hollywood I feel one I never hear of is Native actors getting leads roles. Although admittedly I’ve probably missed something

- **Korea**: They’ve been a bigger box offices in recent years I believe and again could make a fair buck appealing more to the eastern market. Hell get BTS or Blackpink on it that’d help its numbers everywhere with their fanbases

- **Hispanic**: Yes we’ve had Coco and Encanto is coming up but obviously there’s still an entire continent of stories left to tell. Although imagining Disney trying to do a story on the Aztecs is mildly hilarious. Side note given Lin Manuel-Miranda has been doing so much for Disney why not have a Puerto Rican Disney Princess movie it sounds like a match made in heaven for the times

- **African**: Black Panther proved a huge Hollywood blockbuster can take place in Africa. Obviously it’s Marvel and there’s more to it than that but still again an entire continent of content prime to adapt. It’s hard to pick where cos duh it’s a whole continent

- **Middle Eastern**: I know we have Jasmine but given how the world has changed I feel we could do with another Middle Eastern Disney Princess. Maybe Ms Marvel happening will make them more confident to try

Ok that was a lot and I probably missed some stuff but fuck it it’s late this is a bit of a shit post",0
526,2001 space odyssey I know I’m waaaay late to watching this but I’ve never been left so speechless by a movie.

This movie had such a cool way of capturing all of those thoughts I have plus a million more lol. I do have to say whoever installed the monolith in Arizona has a really unique sense of humor lol. That’s what interested me in watching the movie. And between being in a pandemic and in my opinion watching us humans evolve into this digital ai world. We really are in the middle of evolution. 9/10 people can work from home. Meetings are pointless now with zoom. It really leaves you wondering what’s next for humans in the next 50-75 years.

Albert Brooks slicing Bryan Cranston’s arm open was so perfectly in line with his character’s hard-boiled, remorseless, skilled persona.

537,"O Brother Where Art Thou? - the significance of sight (spoilers) I watched this film tonight for the first time in a few years, but have seen it probably 5 times in total. I watched it with my parents, and my mum pointed out that there are so many blind people in it. 

It's something I noticed before but never really considered its significance. 

Long, spoiler filled observations ahead...

We first encounter the blind seer at the start of the film who prophesies about the trios journey ahead (with alarming accuracy). The trio discuss what he told them, and Everett briefly acknowledges that its possible that a man who has lost his vision may be compensated with sight of a different kind, and that its not crazy to think that he may be able to see the future. 

Once Pete points out that the blind seer said that they would *not* find the treasure they seek, Everett quickly changes his tune on the subject - realising that endorsing the seers prophecy could actually jeopardise his plan. But the blind seer was in fact right about everything.

We then see Everett taking advantage of the blind radio presenter when The Soggy Bottom Boys first record the song. He lies and convinces the blind man that there are 2 additional band members who can't write, thus securing 2 additional paychecks for the recording.

Then we meet Big Dan (John Goodman) who is blind in one eye. Ironically Big Dan is able to take advantage of Everett, who, similarly to the blind radio presenter, cannot see the reality of the situation that is unfolding in front of him. Even when Dan clubs Dhelmer with the branch, Everett doesn't see the issue and is surprised when he is immediately hit over the head with the branch too. Everett isn't blind, but in this scene he may as well be.

We also repeatedly encounter the sheriff who is never seen without dark sunglasses and a sniffer dog by his side. We're never explicitly told that he's actually blind, but we do regularly see flames reflected in his glasses. To me this suggests that the sheriff is blind to some aspects of humanity. He has no empathy and appears to be blind towards morality, and even towards the law at the end of the film.

In the end we see the blind seer continuing to push his cart along the train tracks, in exactly the same state as when we first encountered him.

**TLDR**, Everett takes advantage of blind men throughout the film, using their literal lack of sight as a tool to strengthen his story and his chances of success. Meanwhile he is often blind to the situation in front of him, although he can physically see it play out.

With those observations out of the way, I wanted to get some opinions on the significance of this motif throughout the film.

What do you guys think is the message the Coen brothers are trying to portray with this theme? What is the significance of Big Dan being blind in one eye? And what can we take away from the all-seeing blind seer, who predicts the events of the film long before they play out?

This film is no doubt a masterpiece. I used to consider it my favourite Coen brothers film but it was replaced by The Big Lebowski in recent years. Upon rewatching it tonight though, its a really tough call!

Would love to hear what people think about this.",0
538,"An interesting ending to a thriller I just watched Disturbia and although I thought it was pretty good I kept thinking of an ending that would have blown my mind.

Everything he saw had been actually his imagination and hallucination. So the protagonist confronts the supposed killer and embarrasses himself. The next day when his mom goes to the ""killer's"" house to apologize the protagonist hallucinates again and tries to save his mom by killing his neighbor. Which he does. When the police arrives they find out that the protagonist killed the neighbor because he has gone insane and he is sent to an asylum. The credits roll with music as the protagonist is screaming still convinced that the neighbor was a killer.

What do yall think of that?",0

541,Help me find this French movie About 12-13 years ago I started to watch a movie which was in French. The movie was about a guy who went to the groceries and when returning he got kidnapped by two girls. They kept him in a basement as a sex slave for a long time taking turns to have sex whenever they wanted. He was tied to a bed and fed regularly and not abused like physically or beaten. One of the girls was quiet during the intercourse and silent and the other was like really loud. This continued for a long time and the guy was drugged and dropped off in some location. When the guy returned home he found out that he was a missing person and when he told his girlfriend what had happened to him she didn’t believe him. They broke off or sth. So one night after a couple of months this guy happens to be in a party and in one moment he believes he saw one of the girls (the silent one) who had kept him as a sex-slave. He starts to follow her ....and here is where I fell asleep and couldn’t watch what happened next. I have been obsessed with finding this movie since a long time out of curiosity as how it ended.,0

The movie (as much as I can remember) was about a woman, or women, killing people. One had peticulary large breasts, I recall her putting a pill of some kind between her breasts and smothered some guy with them which I'm guessing made him swallow the pill, or he died from smothering I honestly don't know.

I can't remember exactly what happened, but this is what I recall happening;

At the beginning of the movie, it's a flashback to when a mom or dad saw her child get taken by a UFO on their birthday, then it cuts to ghost hunters coming up, they said they were gonna do some things, see if there is a ghost. Their first night staying their, they wake up in the middle of the night to a loud banging on the ceiling, which turned out to be a lot of dead birds that mysteriously died while flying over the house. The second night, (I think) they set up security cameras all over the house, and in the kitchen at a specific time, the mom (of the dead boy) starts getting a nose bleed, when the hunters checked the security camera, they saw the dead boy running behind the mom, they immediately when to check the barn, because that was the direction he was heading.

I don't remember a lot from there, but I also know that there was this wolf thing, and after a few hours, all of the ghost hunters were in their jeep and the wolf thing ran into their jeep and something happened (I don't know)

That's all I can remember, If I didn't leave enough information to identify the movie then I'll think of some more, but if someone can identify this lost tape film, that would be appreciated!",0

I've been rewatching the ""older"" Spiderman movies, and Venom movie was way more fun to watch than either of Andrew Garfield's Spiderman outings. But it's still a bad movie. 

Tom Hardy acted like he was in a horror-comedy B-movie and was maybe the only actor who seemed to realize how dumb the material was. Michelle Williams was *completely* wasted and felt like she shot all her scenes in one day. Riz Ahmed was competent as a young, tech-billionaire baddie, but the movie completely ditches his character as soon as he bonds with Riot. There was a surprising amount of comedy that hinted back to Ruben Fleischer's Zombieland days, but then moments where the movie seemed to asking us to take it more seriously. They made such a big point out of Venom biting off peoples heads that PG-13 level violence didn't do it any favours because we never got to see any real gore. 

I'm not surprised by its poor reception, and I don't disagree with it either. But if they played more into the horror-comedy side of it and went for the gore, I feel like it would've been a super fun ride.",0
559,"The Handmaiden or, the beauty of peak Korean cinema This is a 10/10 movie for me. It has everything: great writing, direction, acting, score, a crazy, imaginative story with twists that completely recontextualize what came before. It also menages to weave seamlessly into this drama that typically weird Korean humor that always cracks me up.
I usually am more of a “character guy”, I’m more interested in the relationships between the protagonists and how those develop, the story for me is usually more of a mean to an end... but here seeing this story unfold and waiting to know where it will take you is a big part of why this movie is so awesome, so I recommend to go in watching this knowing as little as possible.

Park Chan-wook also understands how showing the physical attraction between the protagonists and their desires helps to make their bond stronger in the eyes of the viewer; cinema is a visual medium so it is at its strongest when it depicts action, so the physicality of the protagonists relationship makes it an incredibly ‘real’ one. I should note that this is probably one of the most sensual movies that I’ve ever seen.

I think that is what I love about Korean movies at their best, they are able to do a lot of different things simultaneously and all incredibly well, they are the perfect incarnation of what cinema can do and how impactful movies can be.",0

563,"What's the most infuriating case of a movie blatantly ignoring its own rules or canon? The Holdo maneuver is absolutely one of the most justified complaints about The Last Jedi. In TFA the Millennium Falcon jumps out of hyperspace inside the gravity of a planet under a planetary deflector shield. If this is possible why not hyperspace jump a missile and fire it through any planetary shield creating an unstoppable attack? In TLJ Haldo performs a similar feat by hyperspace jumping into the first order kamikaze style. This may have been impossible due to Interdictor Cruisers stationed along the main flag ship. First seen in Rebels, these ships stopped hyperspace jumps by onboard gravity wells. Gravity wells prevent hyperspace jumps and drag ships out of hyperspace if they get too close to them. In Canon hyperspace travel only works in a straight line, and that ""real space"" mass shadows overlap with hyperspace, and will annihilate ships that pass through them. Therefore the vast majority of interstellar travel exists along well-charted straight lines from A to B, with transit points where refueling points, or stopping to adjust one's heading to go around a nebula or something, are located at expectable deep-space intervals.",0

Is the movie meant to be a morality play for George, or for the audience? If it's a morality play for George, why do we focus on an alternate time line where he never was born? This entire sequence relies on the angel narration that the audience hears throughout the film to help explain why everything is the way it is - the pill poisoning, Harry drowning.


Why don't we just show him the fallout that would occur if he did go through the suicide? See the family fall apart, Potter buy out the bank and town - you would flash forward to a Christmas years later that shows the town in the same state as the alternate timeline but as a result of George killing himself.   
 

That'd also help the audience a bit - because we're shifting to a different timeline and we know this is a Christmas movie (so it HAS to have a happy ending) we know that George will come back and everything will be dandy. If the spirit is showing him the aftermath of his suicide, the audience wouldn't really know if he killed himself or not.

I doubt Harrison Ford would sign onto an action movie in a franchise he made to play that kind of character.

597,"""Wonder Woman 1984"" Spoiler Discussion Megathread: International Discussion I've just came out of the Wonder Woman 1984 and I am blown away by it. The music by Hans Zimmer is EPIC. Pedro Pascal as Maswell Lord is a phenomenal villain. Gal Gadot's acting has improved and nobody does Wonder Woman like she does and once again, the chemistry between Gadot and Chris Pine remains essential. The only disappointment was Kristen Wiig as Cheetah. She wasn't bad but her character was unnecessary, she definitely deserved to be be the main villain in another movie. I wish Jenkins had just used 1984 as an introduction for Barbara Minerva and then had her turn into Cheetah in the 3rd movie, possibly with Circe's help. 

A warning, though: the mood of the film is entirely different. This feels like a comic book movie directed by Baz Luhrman at times, it's very cartoonish at first and then it becomes more and more dramatic and it turns Donner-esque. 

Also, there's not a lot of action in WW84. Jenkins made a comic book movie that is more narrative-based yet it's never dull. The emotional scenes are quite powerful and dramatic and it's hard not to be engaged. CGI is wonky at times but dismissable. 

I also feel the running length is too long. The film would have been better if it was just two hours long. Nevertheless, a superb sequel to Wonder Woman that takes a huge risk and it pays off. Patty Jenkins is a major find and I think she could do Reboot Justice League justice if she was asked to do it in the future.",0

603,"The Expendables 4 ACTORS So I was dissapointed when Jackie Chan did not appear in The Expendables 3, he was confirmed for many months but then they started filming and he was nowhere to be found. I heard it was because of scheduling conflicts but also because Chan himself refused to be in the film. Anyways I was just wondering if/when they make a fourth film would you want him in it as a hero or villain?? I know he has never played a villain before BUT maybe he would say ""fuck it"" and do one for once. OR yes he can appear as a hero in the film a new member of the crew. Also do you think Steven Seagal would appear in a small role?? Thoughts??",0

606,"The Hunt (2012) (Jagten) I finished watching this movie last night and I can't stop thinking about it. I was fortunate enough to go into it without reading any reviews or viewing any trailers... so if you have seen it, you know.

I won't reveal anything about the plot or spoil anything but wow, I loved Mads Mikkelsen in Hannibal which is what drew me into the film, but this had me gripped from start to finish.

All I can say about the movie is that at its heart, the story is ultimately a powerful comment on prejudice, based on true incidents, that may leave you emotionally drained but truly moved if you haven't seen it.

Go in to this blind if you can. Great, great movie.

Are there any other movies out there similar?",0
607,"It was so difficult to watch My Sister's Keeper I thought I knew about Parents being unfair when there's sick/challenged child. My brother is mentally ill, I lost my childhood and mental health because my parents loved only him, while treated me like I was adopted stray cat. No wait a minute, adopted cats would have been treated better than me.

But the mom in the movie, was beyond horrible. I know it's fiction, but I also know parents like her aren't uncommon in real life. Real world parents are having designer babies for the sick child, or demand sacrifice of other children's mental/physical needs.

Also I'm so sure many of those parents would act like Cameron Diaz in the movie(her bitch mother acting was so good I wanted to punch her). ""why can't you understand you have to donate your blood for your sick sister?"" ""let's extract some bone marrow though it'll hurt a bit"" ""What, you don't want to? You're a selfish bit\*\*"" ""Now you don't wanna give one kidney for your dying sister? How dare you, I'm gonna go to court and will cut you up!""

Till the end of the movie, the mother doesn't show any true remorse or guilt for treating Anna like some clone from the movie The Island. She just looks at Anna like 'now let's give you some attention since your sister is dead, you know it's your fault, right? I forgive you because I'm so amazing mother'. That was impression I got at least.

I'm sorry for ranting rather than writing review, but, god, it was horrible to watch the movie.

The movie was well done and I think Abigail should earn some children's Oscar. Cameron Diaz also deserves some award because I wanted to strangle her.

It's sad that the movie and the book aren't that much 'fictional'. If someone said it was based on true story, I'd believe it 100%.",0

610,"Matrix 4 production crew continuity Browsing through IMDB listings for Matrix 4, it becomes clear that most of the crew working on this sequel is actually the crew from the Netflix series Sense8. In fact, there are very few people from any of the original 3 films that were hired back, from the cinematographer, to the production designer, and so on.

What this seems to mean is that this movie will have very little continuity in terms of ""look and feel"" with the original films. This opens up the broader question -- how do we feel about a sequel being made without the original production crew maintaining a consistency of vision?",0
611,"Another Round ending [SPOILERS] Another great collaboration between Thomas Vinterberg and Mads Mikkelsen. Curious what others thought of the ending. I have a lot of thoughts about the movie as a whole but want to talk about the ending. I think it could be taken two ways. 

Either the dance was a celebration of life in the recent aftermath of death. The start of life for all these young students they helped raise. Celebrating being back on track. All three of the teachers had something to celebrate. 

Or it was a little darker, which is the way I read it. They're all getting back on track but the pull of alcohol will inevitably be too much. They were aprehensive about drinking entering the restaurant but a couple minutes later are slamming drinks back again with students, destined to repeat their mistakes. The same mistake that killed their friend. They didn't get the wake up call. Too addicted to feeling the freeness they felt before. 

I'm maybe reading too much into it but curious what others thought.",0
612,"Saw an early screening of Greenland tonight. After a long drought, a disaster movie that does the genre justice. I'll attempt to keep this review spoiler free. I admit, I was slightly hesitant to watch this one, as Gerard Butler's last foray into disaster movies - 2017's *GeoStorm* - was an unmitigated dumpster fire. That said, this movie is a solid entry in the genre, and dare I say up there with some of the best.  It doesn't have any of that over-the-top popcorn-y camp of Independence Day or Armaggeddon (which certainly has its place), but struck a much more emotional note a la Deep Impact. Except here I think it was made even more compelling by focusing in on just one family, rather than multiple storylines. The CGI is well done.  It's inserted where necessary but only just so. There are no crazy set pieces that feel wholly out of place or gratuitous. It all felt as though it fit, and added, rather than distracted, from the tale they were telling.  The characters were smartly written, and common tropes I predicted would be in there often never materialized, to better result. If you're looking for something fresh and movie theater worthy after all these barren months, I recommend you give this a go. We watched it with our 9yo daughter, and there were some scary and emotional moments but she enjoyed it overall. I think it might be rough for anyone younger than that. Overall 9/10.

Edit: I should mention this was a virtual screening at home. We did not go to a theater. It drops on digital streaming in a couple days I believe.",0

618,"Godfather does not use the word ""mafia"" at request of Italian-American group -- did that not work out in the film's favor anyway? But without knowing this at the time, I thought that avoiding throwing around terms like ""mafia"" or ""cosa nostra"" and indeed not showing ceremonies beyond the wedding-day granting of favor was a huge plus over other films. In the first two flicks, Vito is not shown to be anything but a poor and honest man who was forced by circumstances to do what he did.

That is to say, the movies did not feel like they were unnaturally avoiding the word ""mafia."" For one thing, I would guess real members would avoid letting people know they were in it.

I can't think of many gangster films before the 1970s that used the term -- maybe there are some -- but it seems like after The Godfather more explicit indications that the gangsters were actually part of some ""tradition"" were shown.

621,"Wonder Woman 1984 thoughts (major spoilers) The movie just premiered on theaters in Mexico so this is going to be full of spoilers, it's... underwhelming to say the least, I was so eager to see it, can't say that I loved the first one but it was pretty good entertainment and there was definitely a ton of potential, was very excited to see a superhero film in the big screen again.

But man, I really don't know what they were going for, it has an intro in Themyscira that is like a ninja warrior race and Themyscira is never shown again, then first scenes in 1984 are cartoonesque (and not borderline, VERY cartoonesque) and then that theme just goes away and never comes back, Minerva is shown like a nerd would be presented in a low budget sitcom -phd but she didn't even know how to talk, walk, dress, etc-, Maxwell Lord is great when the terrible dialogue or script lets him have good moments.

The whole Chris Pine resurrection feels so... FORCED, we're supposed to believe that Diana spent 40 years crying over a guy and not being able to enjoy anything in the world -no friends, no life, nothing- and her biggest wish was to have him in her life and then risks the fate of the world for him, and he comes back in the body of silencer else and Diana is like ""great let's fuck right now"", man that just felt wrong. 

The whole plan/powers of Maxwel and WW powers are just serviceable for the plot and they seem to change in the need of the script, suddenly Diana can do magic, or the lasso is kinda like telepathy. Cheetah as a feline appears for like 3 minutes in a very dark scene that feels from a different movie, otherwise she's well played by Wig while she's in transition to be a full villain.
 
The 1984 gimmick feels like an afterthought and it just seems to matter when they want to make fun of the eighties.

When they let Diana be WW in all her glory is fantastic, but it just happens like 15 minutes in the whole movie. The final confrontation with Max Lord is just weird, the conflict just... magically solves itself, nevertheless Pedro Pascal is miles ahead everyone else in the movie.

Such a letdown for me, hope your guys enjoy it.",0
622,"GOOD or BAD: The Lost World Jurassic Park (1997) It's not perfect, but [Lost World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxrvaneULkE) is my second favorite Jurassic Park movie after the original. You have Spielberg back in the director's chair, great animatronics, some excellent tension, and who doesn't like a T. Rex running loose in San Diego?

For me, the other Jurassic Park sequels (III, World, Fallen Kingdom) haven't felt as good as Lost World. I know Michael Crichton was pressured to write a sequel to the Jurassic Park book so a sequel could get made, but Lost World will always remain a guilty pleasure for me. What do you think of 1997's The Lost World: Jurassic Park?",0
623,"The Blair Witch Project. Holy crap. Spoilers ahead.

So I just finished The Blair Witch Project and I can now see why it’s this big thing among horror cinema fans. 

Let’s start with the performances. Heather Donahue gives a gut wrenching, incredible performance as this girl who just wants all of this witchcraft and torture to end. Michael C. Williams is also great as one of her companions, a guy who slowly becomes skeptical of Heather’s intentions as the plot goes on. Joshua Leonard is good too as the guy who gets captured by the supposed Blair Witch. All of the leads’ performances are spot on.

The marketing. I cannot stress how amazing the marketing was for this movie. If you don’t know already, they marketed this film like it was a true story, which the found-footage filming style (I believe this film was one of the first to utilize that filming tactic) helped massively with. There were fake missing person flyers with the three leads’ names and pictures, there was an entire website created to promote this film that you can still look up today. It’s really cool to see all the behind-the-scenes stuff that went on during the making of this film.

Additionally, the horror aspect of this film is awesome. Instead of relying on cheap jump scares to enhance the terror, this film relies on the eerie atmosphere that appears as soon as the trio finds the sticks hanging from the trees. It’s really fresh, even if it did come out in 1999. Horror films nowadays are cheap and stupid. Take a movie like Truth or Dare for example, or Fantasy Island, or just about any other Blumhouse teen horror movie. The plots are overdone and the acting always sucks. This movie was a refreshing break from all of that, again even if it did come out in 1999.

The mysterious is always the scariest thing, because everything is left to your imagination. As you hear Heather and the group running away, yelling “What the f**k is that?!?!” you can visualize something terrifying, something that we don’t see explicitly but we can see clearly in our heads.

I’ll end with a quote from Roger Ebert in his review of the film: “The noise in the dark is almost always scarier than what makes the noise in the dark.”",0
624,"Sphere (1998) - why the extreme hate? When this Crichton adaptation released in 1998 it tanked at the box office and was torn apart by critics and unlike other sci fi flops like John Carpenter’s The Thing or Event Horizon hasn’t seem to have gotten any kind of cult following. Hell I even see it show up in some “worst of” lists! Always thought that was strange as i always liked this film. It’s like a mix of Forbidden Planet and The Abyss. Has a great tense and foreboding atmosphere, terrific underwater cinematography, an A list cast giving their A game and strong production values. I also read the Crichton book and the film is very faithful. Probably one of the most faithful adaptations you can think of. Sphere is one of the most underrated sci films and best adaptations of Crichton’s work",0

He isn't. Silver Linings Playbook was all about Jennifer Lawrence's performance whilst American Hustle was all about the wigs. Limitless, sure, it was entertaining - but it wasn't down to Bradley Cooper's performance. The A-Team was essentially Bradley Cooper playing a variation of the same character from The Hangover. The only film Bradley Cooper's been remotely interesting in was The Place Beyond The Pines and, honestly, they could have put someone far better into his role and it would have been just as good.",0

635,"HBO Max is letting moviegoers decide for the first time how they want to watch newly released movies. If consumers decide they want to watch it at home more so than the theaters, doesn't that shine a light on the problem with the movie-going experience? Personally, my favorite way of seeing a film is the movie theater, but because of covid, like many, I will probably watch these new WB movies at home. After covid, I will not, I seriously love movie theaters.

I think those that are saying HBO Max is destroying movies are overreacting. I believe most people who love cinema will continue to go to the theater once things get back to normal. 

However, I've never heard these big time hollywood directors berate the theaters for having $8 hotdogs, unclean theaters, uncomfortable chairs, expensive movie tickets, terrible customer service, boring arcade games if they have any at all, etc etc

Granted, new modern day movie theaters are opening up and having reclined chairs in regular theatres are becoming the norm.

636,"Better movie: An American in Paris (1951) or Singin’ in the Rain (1952)? Both movies are musicals and star Gene Kelly. Both of these movies are very good so this may be a tough call. In this case of American in Paris, it has great George Gershwin music and amazing music sequences. I especially liked the scene where Adam Cook is imagining himself running an entire orchestra. The last 15 minutes are also amazing. The music, the choreography, the sets, the costumes, etc. it’s all a feast for the senses.

Still, Singin’ in the Rain beats it for me. I find the songs in it to be more memorable and iconic. Sure you have the iconic dancing in the rain sequence but there’s also Good Morning and Make Em Laugh which continues to add to the fun. Not to mention there are some funny scenes regarding the transition of silent movies to “talkies” and the cast and crew trying to adapt. It’s all great stuff.

640,"I did a little experiment. Introducing: Alternate BBC Top 100 Films of the 21st Century [Here's the list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14_QlnLXfiIsRC5bCvmkH0mrKQBsv3UTNCKDx4LJ3Sq4/edit?usp=sharing) if you're interested, but if you would let me explain myself first.

I'm a film fan, which inevitably means I'm a fan of movie lists, top 10's, top 100, etc. One of the more interesting lists to come out recently was the BBC Top 100 Movies of the 21st Century. It's an interesting list, meant to highlight modern day classics, but what was most fascinating was how they tallied the votes. 177 critics the world over where asked to rank their 10 favorite films from the 21st century, with their first place pick receiving 10 points, second place receiving 9 points, and so on until their tenth place film, which would receive 1 point. It more or less made sense, but it did make me think about another famous all time great films list, Sight and Sound's Centennial Poll. In that one, people are also asked to name 10 films, but their votes only count as 1 point. So it got me thinking, what if the BBC list was voted on the same way? Instead of ranking them, what if people simply picked 10 movies? How would this turn out? Of course, it's not an apple's to oranges comparison. The Sight and Sound list is a formal poll held every 10 years, split into critics and directors, and all films ever made are eligible. BBC's was just a one and done thing, with only a relatively few number of critics compared to Sight and Sound, and obviously  choices were limited to 21st century films. Still, I wanted to see what this alternate list would look like, and since BBC handily showed every critic's list, I got straight to work with my handy buddy, Google Sheets.  The result was, well the list above.

Again, this was just an interesting little experiment. I have no issues with how BBC conducted their list, and I'm not out to make a point. I just had a lot of time on my hand and I knew that if I thought about it anymore, I would never make it, so I just got straight to work. 

If you're still reading you're obviously interested, so here's some interesting facts.

* Separated by one measly vote, in the alternate list ""In the Mood for Love"" dethrones ""Mulholland Drive"" to be the new number 1 film. Evidently, on the official list while Love was included more, Mulholland placed higher to reach the top.
* In truth, the entire top 10 on both lists have the same films, with the 3rd through 6th spots having the same placements on both lists, but from then on the spots are shifted around. The farther down you go on the alternate list, the more it diverges from the official one.
* Ties are ranked alphabetically, but you'll see that there's plenty of them on the lower half of the alt list. I believe this has to do with how varied the lists were (there were 587 different films listed, with 339 receiving only 1 vote) and with the fact that while 177 is a lot of people, it's relatively small compared to the likes of Sight and Sound's most recent 2012 poll, with a whopping 846 critics voting, and another 358 directors voting on their own list.
* I don't have time to check every single film that got knocked out in the alternate list and which new ones made it in, but SOME notable additions on the alternate list were Birdman, Selma, Femme Fatale, Kill Bill Vol 1 (one other person voted for Vol 2, so theoretically if counted as one film, kill bill would land even higher), and.... Borat. All were frequent picks, but due to their lower placement on the list, they missed landing on the official top 100.
* I think I'm missing one or two films that I neglected to add on the alternate list, but they received only one vote, I was nearing the end, my fingers were dying, and I wanted to be over with it, so yeah. If you'd like, the BBC showed [all the critics and how they voted, so there you go.](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films-who-voted)

This year my short list has become War With Grandpa, Godmothered, or possibly The Martian. As I said, they're conservative, so too much swearing? They turn it off. Gay characters kissing? They turn it off. A long or too revealing sex scene? They turn it off. You get the idea. This is why even PG-13 is a toss up. And they have N3tflix and Prim3, so I don't want to get anything that's already on those services.

Thanks!

643,"Not Another (Teen Movie) Top 10 Movie List This isn't a best movie list, just my 10 favorite movies. I'd say that 5 or 6 of these are pretty set in stone, and the other 4-5 I could interchange depending on how I'm feeling. I do really enjoy every single one of these though. I'd love to hear your thoughts, or your own list.

&#x200B;

1.Dragonheart - I really just love this movie, and I can't recommend it enough. The CGI holds up. The soundtrack shines and is one of my favorite ever, especially To The Stars.

&#x200B;

2. Star Trek (2009) - \*Disclaimer\* I had not watched any other Trek films and maybe a handful of episodes before this. I'm no movie critic, but I think this movie is just great on all levels. They nailed the casting, story, and atmosphere here. It's a movie I could watch again and again.

&#x200B;

3. Transformers (2007) - Not a lot of movies have given me chills the way that this one did the first time I saw Optimus transform, and I'll never forget it. I loved transformers growing up. Watched the cartoons, and to see them put to life on the big screen like this was surreal for me. I also happen to enjoy the score quite a bit. The Bumblebee scene will make me cry, every time.

&#x200B;

4. Howl's Moving Castle/ Spirited Away - I flip flop back and forth on which one of these is my favorite Miyazaki movie. In fact, I really enjoy all of his movies, the soundtracks, art, and stories are always great. You're doing yourself a disservice if you've never seen any of them.

&#x200B;

5. Beverly Hills Ninja - This has to be my favorite Farley movie. It has it all, action, romance, comedy, and it's just so cheesy that it's great. The Tarzan Boy scene when he's swinging on the palm tree makes me laugh every time. 

&#x200B;

6. How to Train Your Dragon - I love dragons, and I love this movie. The world, the art, the story, the music, are all top notch for me. It's a cliche movie, but if you're gonna be cliche, might as well knock it out of the park.

&#x200B;

7. The Last Samurai - I have no idea either how historically accurate this movie is, but I really enjoy the setting. The story always draws me in, and I always get so mad at the ending. Good acting too, just a good movie for me.

&#x200B;

8. Interstellar - I saw this movie in Dolby with an empty theater except for my buddy and I, and it was mind-blowing. I have a very active imagination, and this movie just did it for me. Never once did I think about it, or question how things could happen, I just enjoyed it. One of the movies that makes me feel like a kid staring in wonder up at the stars.

&#x200B;

9. About Time - My favorite RomCom ever. The acting is superb, it's so much more than just a Romance movie. The setting is great, and the relationship with his sister and dad is perfect. This movie always makes me tear up, if you've seen it, you know when.

&#x200B;

10. The Punisher - Thomas Jane is the Punisher, he gets revenge, and he does it in style. Not the greatest movie, but it is a guilty pleasure of mine.",0

Back to the Future, Real Genius, Leviathan, Firefly , Titan A.E., Total Recall, The Abyss, Amazing Stories, Aliens, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Alien, Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope, Conan, Dark Star. HE WAS UNREAL.

So, in revisiting his work, I'm watching Last Starfighter blu ray, and realize it's not only magical, but if they're peeling off gamers from places like earth, there are endless worlds that you could build into the universe, and I'm almost thinking a reboot of this could be more interesting and imaginative than Star Wars, and where it has chosen to boldly not go. Yes that's a Star Trek pun, sorry.

I guess I'm saying give it a watch if you haven't, and like gaming or sci-fi. But also if anyone in the know actually knows about TLS IP and if it has any plans, I would be fascinated to know!

There's only two movies left that actually deserve or need to be remade, and it's LSF ""next generation"", and Trading Places w/ Dan and Eddie being Mortimer and Randolph.

648,"What Movie Made an Impact on You and the Audience in the Theater, and because of that it Stood out to you? For me there are 3 movies that were such a huge impact on people and myself watching in the theater, that I can clearly remember. The first was Signs, when the Alien appeared in the end in the reflection of the TV screen and everyone in the theater screamed, Everyone. Second, In Insidious, when the Darth Maul Demon appeared and everyone's heart just gave out and all I could hear was a high pitch cry from a loud crowd. Finally the third, In Avengers: Endgame, there were several in the movie, but the most impactful was when Thanos snapped his fingers and I have never heard a theater so silent before, then all of a sudden it turns to sadness. Its amazing to me how much watching a movie with a full audience is different then watching it at home. What has your experience been like?",0

655,"Black Water Abyss Review Just seen this film on Netflix let’s explore this cave.

Let’s start with the things I like which isn’t a lot. Eric is actually a pretty cool character. I like his bit with Cash when they were trying to find the way out. Cash was also probably the smartest character. I swear some of these characters are dumb asf. That’s about all I like.

Now the things I don’t like:
-The Movie feels so long and boring
There are so many scenes that are just filled with nothing but silence and staring at shit. The characters conversations don’t even feel any emotion. They’re trying to convince us that they are long term friends and best friends. Especially Jen, holy hell.

-The characters: Mainly Jen
If you’re making any movie, you need good characters. The characters in this film are so stupid I can’t even. Let’s start of at the start of the film. Why is Jen snooping through Eric’s phone and we’re supposed to like her already. No I’ll think your a bit of a bitch. Our first introduction to our main character is already making me dislike her. Next bit which makes me dislike her is that she is so fucking selfish. I know it’s realistic to be selfish in those situations but come on, when the croc was coming towards her and Victor. She climbs the rock first instead of Victor. Now to be fair, it might’ve been easier to pull him up then to push him up but I don’t know. Also Victors death is stupid. Instead of climbing to safety, he looks at the water like “oh I think it’s gone” why would it be gone? Just climb back up to be safe. When Jen, Eric and Yolanda meet up again, Jen tells them that Victor has died and instead of saying anything nice or comforting Yolanda. She bitches her way into making her feel like shit even more. Jen pretty much says fuck you I don’t care that your husband just died. You two cheated so fuck you. Also if it was an accident, why do you put up photos of each other and put other proof that Jen probably all ready found out about. 

-The Ending
Oh god, Eric doesn’t need to die here. Honestly think if they all swam to the exit they all would’ve made it but what ever. Now the car crash scene is so retarted I can’t. Instead of maybe you know, pushing the brake pedal. You drive into the water you were just in. Surly you knew it was there because you just came from there. 

Next up is the actual ending. Jen instead of helping Yolanda she selfishly goes quicker to escape. Tbf she did start to shoot the croc but wait, WITH ONE HAND AIM, wtf. Surly she’s stupid right, maybe use both arms to have better grip and accuracy. Idk but when Yolanda finally gets up, instead of running, she keeps shooting even though she’s shit. Fuck off. I wish she died at the end. Thanks for Reading, leave your own thoughts about the film.",0

659,"thoughts on Paddleton (2019) No, not the movie about the bear. Paddleton, starring Mark Duplass and Ray fuckin’ Romano is one of the most slept on movies I can remember watching. This is a Netflix original that went completely under the radar, about two neighbors who have a strong friendship and just about nothing else. Mark Duplass’s character finds out he has a severe form of cancer, and decides he wants to end his own life before his condition miserably does it for him. In order to get the medicine to do this, a road trip ensues as the two men travel to get the pills that are supposed to take Duplass’s life. This film seems endlessly funny until the last 10-15 minutes hit like a train. Duplass is fantastic but Ray Romano was made for this role - most of his lines weren’t scripted, he fit the character perfectly as far as tone and comedic timing. I don’t know anyone else who has seen this, really just hoping to hear some thoughts other than my own. Definitely check out Paddleton if you haven’t already.",0

665,"Why did they kick Precious out of high school? Is this a thing that is done? If a girl gets pregnant, the high school kicks her out? How is that fair in any way? How is this anything other than kicking her while she is down, and making it even more likely that she will never achieve anything?

If this is truly a practice then it's deplorable. They are discriminating against students who are victims of rape/incest, or who can't afford or do not want an abortion, or who just simply had sex and now have to deal with raising a child potentially on their own, with all the handicaps that that brings. Do they kick out male students for knocking up female students? If they don't then that is a horrible double standard. Many things in the movie Precious disgusted me and opened my eyes to how hard some youths have it, but for her to get kicked out of high school because of something that she didn't want to have happen to her is despicable.",0

Watching the film again I’m actually shocked this made it into the final cut. It’s awkward and almost refuses to be taken seriously. 

Everything about this scene is awkward, the glass breaks out of nowhere, and DeNiro is kicking him with the worst sound effects, I’m honestly shocked Scorsese didn’t think to take this out.

Maybe it’s because it was for Netflix that people weren’t as pressured to make the film as good as it should be, but just completely shocked this goofy scene actually made it in.

I had tried putting it on once before, but it didn’t hold my attention. Not because it’s boring, it’s just something you have to be in the mood for. 

It’s definitely more of a science fiction movie than I expected going in. Obviously the protagonist isn’t very strong because he’s supposed to be a blank slate for the viewer to envision themself as. Sharlto Copley is amazingly entertaining though and the main villain works well enough. 

The first third of the movie is a little rough as far as camera work goes. A little too shaky when the main character is constantly running in different directions, but once you get into it, things become much more comfortable and the action is more clear. Speaking of action, I loved the use of practical effects. Obviously there are some computer effects being used, but I always love a good rubber head explosion. Much more gory than I expected, which is a plus for me. 

All that being said, this is a fun ride to go on at home with a couple of friends.

One response might be that the ending indicates that Stevens is not just in Fentress’s memories, but in an entire alternate world constructed from these.

702,"""Ghost"" was a popular film when it first came out. Today, it comes off as dated and comically awful. It's still worth seeing because of Whoopi Goldberg as Oda Mae Brown though her character seems like she belongs in a different film. 

Swayze and Moore are godawful together. I mean, cheesy dialogue like ""ditto"" and the endless usage of the instrumental version of Unchained Melody. Did anyone who was over 21 take the film seriously at the time?

704,"GOOD or BAD: Home Alone 3 (1997) The OG Home Alone is a Christmas classic. I like Home Alone 2 a little less, but it’s still good. Now we come to Home Alone 3. Directed by Raja Gosnell (the man behind the live-action Scooby-Doo and Smurfs movies) Home Alone 3 has no connection to the previous two entries. There’s no Macaulay Culkin, no Joe Pesci, and no Daniel Stern. Granted, Culkin was 17 at the time and having left Home Alone again wouldn’t have made sense, but Home Alone 3 lacks the charm of the previous two entries. 

Instead of Culkin, we have Alex D. Linz as Alex Pruitt. Not a bad kid, but he’s pretty forgettable. If anything, it’s more worth noting that Scarlett Johansson is in this movie as Alex’s older sister. She doesn’t really do anything other than be mean to her younger brother, but it’s interesting to see one of the most famous and highest-paid actresses in the world get her start. 

Other than that, the first act of HA3 drags, the only thing that makes this movie worth watching is that it has some decent slapstick with the traps. It’s just so funny seeing these four spies who work with terrorists get thwarted by some young kid. Still, some of these traps are unbelievably precise like Alex had to know exactly where these guys would sit and fall for them to activate. Overall, I find Home Alone 3 to be bad with some redeeming qualities.",0

706,"Whats the name of this movie? So, ive been looking for a movie that i watched years ago. So why not ask in a subreddit full of movie enthusiasts?
So, I think I've seen this movie in 2009/2010 in German television but It was definitely a movie that wasn't produced in germany.
I only remember very few things I've seen. Maybe someone can help me?

So, it was a movie about a kidnapping. The kidnapper kept the victim, a young woman, in some kind of factory building or something. She always had a box made out of wood i guess on her head that was locked, the kidnapper opened that box when he came to her to do weird things. 

Is that familiar to someone? Can someone help me? I remember that was a pretty good movie and I wanna watch it again.",0

709,"What's the name of this old cartoon? Involves an old witch woman in a desert land who dies in an erupting volcano. Hey r/movies !   
I grew up in the early 90's watching a cartoon movie I just can't remember the title of, nor the details. However one thing from that movie has been stuck in my mind forever.   


In the movie there is a group of people (or atleast a guy!) that walks in a desert kind of land. (think grand canyon-ish). it then pans to an old (scary looking) woman following them from up in the hills/cliffs/mountains. She is scary looking, tan skinned, thin with a hunchback. I believe she is a witch, but not sure about this.   


Anyways, I believe she dies at the end being trapped under a rock in an erupting volcano? or atleast somewhere where things are falling down.    


This is all I remember from the movie.   


Does anyone know what the title of this cartoon movie is, or remembers it?",0

How did Heihachi die? I only saw he got  hit somehow by the swort of rikichi when he tried to hold him back from running into the burning house. Was that all or did I miss something?

My favorite character was  Kikuchiyo, what a surprize I know. Not holding back any feelings and proving he's way more than just a wannabe samurai but also feeling the pain of the villagers since he was in the same situation himself.

717,"There Will Be Blood is the Most Overrated movie of all time, and one of the worst of all Oscar bait films. We all know the movie is slow and hard to watch. 

But it’s central points and meaning are also dry, have been done before, and shoved down your throat throughout the entire movie without any semblance of real symbolism. It also is incredibly unrealistic in how it’s characters behave, while selling as an ultra-real depiction of how capitalism really was back in the Oil Boom. 

It’s a movie for people that don’t understand what good writing and deep symbolism look like, so that when they see this they can go “oh wow...the capitalism killed religion...very deep...”

Please explain why I’m wrong",0

728,"2020 Original Films from Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon  

Hello! I'm curious to hear about the community's thoughts on films that streamed this year on the big three: Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon. I'm looking for a top 3 or a top 5. And as a follow-up question, to what extent do you find these movies sticking to your guts? I have to say that for the most part, no matter how memorable the movie may be, they tend to go in one ear and out the other. Perhaps it's because of the mundane settings in which I watch the film - i.e., my house.

Thanks for any and all replies!",0
729,"Which actors/actresses had a brief moment where they seemed to become stars but it never went anywhere? Moira Kelly

She began her career with an Oscar nominated film and as the lead in a movie based off a hit TV show. Plus The Cutting Edge, while it hardly lit the box office on fire, was a hit in home video sales. Had she found the right role, she might've become a bigger name (Also, no, The Lion King doesn't count, it's VO and voice acting hardly leads to bigger and better things on camera).",0

The next chosen person is some guy who is more or less a Salvation Army volunteer working at a mall. Meanwhile, there's a black guy who happens to be an amateur thief at this same mall. Just as Santa was about to pass his gift, the thief collides into the crowd, and Santa passes the gift to him.

So yeah, it's a black Santa story, and I remember it being pretty wholesome. But I haven't seen it in over a decade, so any help would be appreciated.",0

1. It must be a good movie by standards of quality, enjoyability, and general competence. Most Christian movies have little interest in being compelling films in their own right. A good movie must be able to stand on its own merits as a work of art.

2. The text of the film must be overtly Christian. Allegory and metaphor are gray areas, but the main themes and plot of the movie must be specifically focused on Christianity as a whole, or elements of Christianity.

3. The message of the film must be overall pro-Christianity, but it must also treat the opposing perspective with enough respect to be compelling. A good Christian movie posits both positive and negative aspects of Christianity, but ultimately finds itself in favor of Christianity.",0
739,"One of the worst parts of The Godfather 3 is how different Michael acts in it, thoughts? I suppose its a mix of Al Pacino changing as an actor + the writing but Michael in GF3 just doesn't feel like the same character at all. Michael in GF1+2 was the quiet and calm type. He wasn't someone who talked about his feelings openly, who joked around etc. Even when GF3 Michael gets angry its more like Tony Montana than Michael from the first two movies 

People change when they get older but to me it felt like a different character. There was no continuity. This is just one of the reasons I   I just ignore it, for me the story ended with GF2",0

741,"mediocre actors whose careers are largely founded by nepotism? First of all I just want to say that nepotism a system not exclusively rampant to the entertainment industry (as in music, Hollywood and even theatre) the legacy admission into an elite university for example, or someone being hired as admin staff at their dad/uncles law firm.

Nepotism is pretty massive in Hollywood, and like in the professional world, nepotism and being qualified together frequently lead to opportunities. I don't think anyone is going to argue that Daniel Day Lewis isn't a phenomenal actor, but his father Cecil was a respected and knighted poet and so I think it probably opened door for young Daniel that were closed to others. Daniel probably wouldn't still be relevant or lauded if he wasn't actually amazingly talented.

Lady Gaga is another figure who has similarly fortunate circumstances with extraordinary talent. Germanotta grew up in a penthouse on 5th Avenue with millionaire parents who could afford piano lessons, catholic school and even a guest role on The Sopranos in 2001 when she was 15. Perhaps because of all that privileged breeding she was able to develop her gifts. She has something to say and has been successful in redirecting pop music and even performances and the aesthetic of the late 2000s and early 2010s. Now she is a classic entertainer who will remain in the public consciousness for decades in the vein of Barbra Streisand, Elton John, or Bette Midler. Like Day Lewis, she wouldn't still be relevant if she wasn't actually talented or intelligent about her craft.

I want you to respond with actors who aren't terrible but who have blown you away, people who just give decent performances, but nothing too remarkable. A lot of the time you can chuck this up to typecasting and personalities that are charismatic or that appeal to specific demographics. Who are some people who keep getting roles in spite of not being all that compelling? Not to say they are actively bad but that their connections made the greatest difference or go their foot in the door.

Who are the figures who confirm that it's an elitist culture that runs our world and not a meritocracy that rewards hard or deserving work.  And again there are many examples to be found outside Hollywood.",0

Are both the characters still in love or is it just Mr.Chow who still remembers and loves her?  And where did the child come from? Is it Mrs.Chan's? And does it mean she's living happily ever after with her husband but just came to the old apartment to relive her memories? 

Someone pls clear out these, thank you.

748,"For anyone that complains about main characters making stupid decisions — watch Run. One of my biggest pet peeves in movies is when the supposedly smart protagonist makes a ludicrously stupid decision because that was the only way the writers could think to move the plot along; or conversely, an objectively dumb character wins the day because of unbelievable plot contrivances. Which is why I was so pleasantly surprised by *Run* a Hulu film made by the same directing duo behind *Searching* (a great mystery-thriller from a few years ago).

For those who don’t know, the film is about a sheltered teenage girl afflicted by numerous health conditions who begins to suspect that her mother is fabricating and causing her illnesses to keep her vulnerable and in constant need of care. Now while I don’t think the film is perfect (I generally take issue with the motivations of the mother), I think the daughter, Chloe, is one of the best recent examples of a smart protagonist who constantly makes decisions that are both understandable and actually reasonable in her attempt to escape her situation. 

The film very smartly establishes that as a sheltered, homeschooled child, Chloe has built up a lot of hobbies and that require a specific and unique set of skills, and then lets each of these skills serve a specific purpose in the escape from her mother. This makes all of her decisions and the subsequent plot reveals feel earned, and never contrived for the sake of moving the story along. Furthermore, whenever possible, Chloe chooses caution over results, making sure she isn’t caught by her mother, which is a very natural and relatable reaction to her situation. She is in a position of weakness and uncertainty so it’s understandable that she doesn’t take unnecessary risks. 

What makes the film even more compelling is that her mother is frequently a step ahead of her, making it a real battle of wits between the two for Chloe to win. And frequently, Chloe’s clever solution to a problem is stymied because her mother has an explanation and/or plan for everything. 

Ultimately, this film is a thrill to watch because it leverages our natural capacity for fear and anxiety while never asking us to break our suspension of disbelief when one of the two main characters gain the upper-hand, which is a sorely missing aspect from most modern thrillers. I’d love to hear what people think about this film, as it’s a surprise favorite of mine this year.

754,"What's that movie? - Troubled young man has visions of a spaceship coming to pick him up Hi all,

The movie I'm thinking of is from the 80s or maybe 70s. About a teenager/young man leading a trouble life, who has dreams or visions of a spaceship that is going to come pick him up from Earth. Drama, I think. Definitely not a comedy or campy.

Trying to track it down for inspiration for a project. Any help/pointers to that or even some other movie with a similar recurring theme would be great.

Thanks.

Fire in the Sky, Mysterious Skin, Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Amazing Stories: Moving Day. Thanks to all for your inputs. Going to have to (re)watch them all.",0
755,"No Such Thing So, I was motivated to post about this movie because an r/AskReddit post struck gold and got me thinking about immortality. What would I do with it?

I worked in a Blockbuster when No Such Thing came out and rented it out of curiosity. Anything that was small budget and had an interesting synopsis, I watched. I was extra curious because of the presence of Helen Mirren and Sarah Polley (thanks Baron Munchausen!) She was in Dawn of the Dead later but that's beside the point.

During this period of time, I watched so many amazing movies. This one has stuck with me. Partially because Robert John Burke (of Robocop 3 fame at the time) was in the starring role. And partially because the story was just so damn cool and unique.

If  you haven't seen it and have an appreciation for weird, independent movies, check it out. It's one of those random gems that flew by most people.

760,"Was U.S. Marshals an unnecessary sequel to The Fugitive? Hello Redditors,

My friends and I are discussing on whether The Fugitive (1993) deserved the average sequel, US Marshals (1998). 

I'm kind of torn on it, I enjoyed both films but honestly, I think it would have been better as a standalone rather than a sequel. One friend specifically thinks that it was a fine sequel, while my other friend thinks it was unnecessary. My father loves US Marshals more than The Fugitive but was unaware that they were related haha.

What did you guys think? I think it would have been better as a standalone kind of like Hobbs and Shaw, I think that movie should have been a stand-alone as well. Speed 2 to me is more of an unnecessary sequel/bad movie.",0
761,"How the Grinch Stole Christmas (2000) Demonstrates just how Razor-Thin the Line is Between Being a Stinker and a Holiday, Pop-Culture Classic. I recently rewatched How the Grinch Stole Christmas - the one with Jim Carrey. Possibly for the first time i actually *watched* the movie as an adult. 

I, like many of you, have seen the movie countless times, whether it be playing at my house as kid, a Christmas party, in grade-school, in college (we actually watched this movie in my Theories of Personalities class) or just in the background during Christmas time - but never really paid attention to it. 

Anyways, I just sat down and watched it again and wow - The movie is just kinda *meh* and a little creepy. I thought to myself, ""If anyone else knew i didn't like this movie, I would be put on a very naughty list.""

I was sure this movie was rated highly on Rotten Tomatoes so I looked it up. [Rotten by users and critics](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/how_the_grinch_stole_christmas)

Goddamn I was not expecting that. They must have made a ton of money on the movie though right? 

[Eh, doubled their budget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_the_Grinch_Stole_Christmas_(2000_film))

Following in the footsteps of How The Grinch Stole Christmas, three years later The Cat in the Hat is released. They seem to follow the same formula:

Legendary Dr. Seuss book

Whacky comedian Mike Meyers replaces whackier comedian Jim Carrey following Meyer's incredible success with Shrek. 

Relatively unknown cute blonde kid Dakota Fanning replaces relatively unknown cute blonde kid Taylor Momsen.


....and it's heralded as one of the [*worst* movies of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cat_in_the_Hat_(film))

We are talking single-digit Rotten Tomato scores and breaking even on budget. 


The phenomenon is that even though How the Grinch Stole Christmas isn't regarded as a good movie by really any review, ratings, or box office scores, at this point it's almost blasphemous to say you don't like How the Grinch Stole Christmas. There's no metric for that, but try it. Try it at your family Christmas-whatever. Try it on your Tinder date. Shits not going to go well.

Look at these headlines:

Admittedly I only saw the original once, haven’t seen it again mainly because I didn’t care for it. I see the appeal. The actors do a good job playing goofy wack jobs. It has some good atmosphere. People enjoy the grainy documentary feel of it, but I personally didn’t care. What killed it for me is how fake it looks. There is not much blood and pretty much no gore, which people seem to like. But come on, it’s called Texas Chainsaw Massacre for fucks sake. I was shaking my head at how little blood there was from being murdered with a Chainsaw. The remake, to me, is better for several reasons. In my opinion the remake does a much better job giving you the feeling of being stuck in the middle of nowhere with no one to help you but weirdo townsfolk who seem very off. R Lee Ermey does a great job as the Sheriff who *really* makes you feel uncomfortable. The lead protagonist is the most likable in the series, and played by a decent actress (Jessica Biel). The scene in the trailer with the baby is a great horror chill. This version of leatherface is scarier to me as he seems more angry and hateful of normal people, while in the Original he was more of a scared man-child. His mask is here is also a better design.

- No Black and White
- No Muppets (she hates those things)
- No ""Scrooged“ (I love Bill Murray as much as everyone but I think it‘s too meta if you don‘t know the story)

I tend towards some adaptation from the nineties but I can’t remember who was in it, only that it was rather dark and I‘m interested in the one with Patrick Stewart, because I never watched it ...

790,"What are the Darkest, dark comedies? For a sub genre, dark comedies can vary in their tone by a huge amount.

You can get something like ""weekend at bernies"" in which people play with a dead body for an hour and a half, yet the film is super lighthearted and you'd have a difficult time trying to find someone who was emotionally affected by it. 

On the other hand, you can get something like ""in bruges"", which while still hilarious, and the tone not super serious throughout, has some properly dark and sad moments. 

So what is the darkest dark comedy? 

My vote goes to ""the apartment"" by Billy Wilder. 

(Spoilers) 

The film starts with our main character mr Baxter being used and exploited by his bosses. That continues through most of the film, until we get to the section where Ms Kubilik tries to kill herself, and we get some heartbreaking sequences where Baxter is trying to remove all the sharp Items in the house, and putting on a happy face to try and prevent her from trying to kill herself again. Throughout all of him this, he also takes the blame for being the scumbag who made her want to die, to protect his superiors. The only reprieve is that Baxter and Kubilik get together in the end, but it's a pretty bitter win considering all that has happened, and the lack of accountability for all the womanisers at work.

As far as comedies go, I think it's the most depressing and sad I've seen. Though, to its credit, the jokes are all on point. In a lighter film I would have been laughing a ton.

Does anyone have a comedy that they think can outdo that? I'm interested to know",0

And before they were inevitably destroyed they sent out their children and the Grinch was the child of one of the Mayors.

Bit of a random thought for a Tuesday but here goes. I’ve been watching some of the old Clint Eastwood movies, the westerns and Dirty Harry and today I caught the end of Father of the Bride. 

So, the difference in movie making and the style and the look of these films from the 70’s to the early 90’s is very apparent. But I don’t see that difference with newer movies. 

Films like point break, backdraft and city slickers were all out in 1991 and it’s weird to think that in just 9/10 years apart you get films like fight club, the matrix, gladiator and they seem like worlds apart in terms of how they look. 

Now, if you look back say 13 years ago to Transformers. I’d say that, that movie could come out today and it would look exactly the same. But you couldn’t say that for these older movies I don’t think.

[There's a description of that in one scene with a lot of detail about a hindu girl raped to death by an entire colony muslims (maybe over a 100 men), which was incredibly common story back 75 years ago.] But even through all that, life must go on. Old friends must learn to hate each other so they can work though this mess, even at the cost of thousands of lives, so millions more can be saved.

The overtone of the movie is also the control of men over women. Women cant be allowed to live in peace anywhere. The Men must and always imposes their will on women. 

I dont want to spoil the movie. But if anyone wants to know a bit more on ground detail about the genocide than thats on various books, give this a go. 

Its on Disney+ Hotstar for India and Amazon Prime Videos in a heavily censored version which omits a lot of important things.

I  love the movie, the story, the acting, the ENDING, the music, etc. I  think it was very popular in itS time with even several Oscar  nominations: Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Tuesday Weld) and Best  Cinematography (William A. Fraker).

I  have only able to watch it in VHS or laserdisco rip with a very  mediocre quality but without censorship and in it's correct aspect  ratio. I think I have read that music copyrights are too expensive for  so little DVD/Streaming  sales. I don't know. Some people rumored that  Diane Keaton (the lead character) does not want to watch it again while  she is alive.

- Connery - Very rapey, wears a toupee (allegedly), takes the absolute piss with his license to kill and slaps women like there's no tomorrow. Still a good lad, but he's very rough. He lacks the sophistication that Moore does to be a British secret agent.

- Dalton - Magical guy, but too intense for me. Clearly has anger issues. Good movies though

- Lazenby - Man's Australian, he can fucking do one

- Brosnan - The closest we got to a true Moore successor. Had the look, the charm, the intensity of Connery. However, his movies after Goldeneye just nosedived. Whoever wrote them must've been on crack

- Craig - First movie is good. Looks the part, but his movies are too interested in being the British Bourne Identity and I ain't about that

Also Moore has the best Henchman ever (Jaws) and I will fight you on it. But not if you say Odd-job because he was cool too

I never thought I’d see a “gritty” Santa movie but this one delivered without being over the top. Santa is cool, family friendly, and a subtle bad ass all in this movie. 

Santa = badass is something I never knew I wanted. 

I thought for sure CC2 was going to go further in this direction, hell maybe even a fight scene (but thinking about that now maybe that’s a bit ridiculous) but the story is just awful. Maybe one of the worst modern Christmas stories ever. Weird elf thing, time travel, magical landscapes, maybe it sounded better in the writing room but the execution was god awful. 

I know my hopes are missing the point of a Christmas movie, but they set the bar so high with CC1. I could have seen a cinematic universe with Santa and others (in the same grounded style) eventually coming together to do something...family friendly. 

Who knows, maybe CC2 is the “Thor 2” of this trilogy and it will get back to its roots for the next one.

> Critics consensus: Great Hera! Wonder Woman 1984 is an epic dose of heart and vibrant escapism that proves there are still unexpected thrills to be found in superhero cinema.

[Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/movie/wonder-woman-1984): 67/100 (27 critics)

As with other movies, the scores are set to change as time passes. Meanwhile, I'll post some short reviews on the movie.

> There's still a lot to love. Gadot remains a charismatic presence who wields the lasso with authority, even tethering lightning bolts in some arresting moments. However, I missed the more hand-to-hand gladiatorial aspect of so many fight scenes in the first movie. There's a disarming romantic touch in Diana acquiring the ability of flight through Steve's explanation of its rudimentary principles. But watching her soar through the air — while consistent with later editions of the comic — also detracts from the athletic leaps that make the character distinctive, turning her into an ersatz Superman with a cuter outfit.

-[David Rooney, The Hollywood Reporter](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/wonder-woman-1984-film-review)

> “Wonder Woman 1984” is all about playing with magic and wishes and desires, only to see them lead to horrible ramifications, instant gratification, and the revelation that lying is never without consequence. Those are some big swings, and not every single one lands, but the ones that do are both joyous and genuinely worth pondering. And yet it’s also brimming with the same wonder and joy as the first film, the rare movie — of any stripe — that doesn’t just want to believe in the goodness of people, but is willing to make them truly work for it. That’s superheroic.

-[Kate Erbland, IndieWire](https://www.indiewire.com/2020/12/wonder-woman-1984-review-gal-gadot-sequel-1234603077/): B

> As the wishes stack up and the world falls into chaos, “Wonder Woman 1984” loses its way, and while it’s not bad enough to renounce the satisfaction of what came before, it’s enough to shift our focus back to our own real-world predicament. What we need right now this movie can’t solve, but just maybe, it will inspire someone who can.

-[Peter Debruge, Variety](https://variety.com/2020/film/reviews/wonder-woman-1984-review-sequel-1234853844/)

> Not everything in “WW84” works perfectly. Kristen Wiig is as terrific as you’d expect as Barbara/Cheetah, but in the latter incarnation her getup is a little too close to “CATS” for comfort. And while Pedro Pascal makes for an entertaining foil, he’s about as menacing as a second-tier Bond villain and clearly no match for Diana Prince, let alone Wonder Woman. Still, it’s absolutely thrilling to see the great Amazon warrior taking flight once again and making the world a much better and safer place. Wonder Woman is a hero for the ’80s and a hero for the ages.

> Still, the action-packed, heartwarming flick hits more than it misses, especially for fans waiting through a year full of release delays. And fortunately, Jenkins is the resident Santa Claus, gifting us this holiday season – even those stuck at home – with an action-packed, heartwarming flick full of grace, goodness and a tank-flipping, whip-smacking, baddie-bashing Gadot.

> Even if the notion of wishes — making them, and then takesies-backsies — isn’t quite a cinematic enough concept to support Wonder Woman’s final face-off with Lord, “Wonder Woman 1984” still brings a freshness and a wit that’s often lacking in these gargantuan costumed-hero sagas. Can’t wait to see what she does in the ’90s.

-[Alonso Duralde, The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/wonder-woman-1984-film-review-ww84-gal-gadot-kristen-wiig/)

> Originally set for release in December 2019, a series of delays have meant that Wonder Woman 1984 has come to us a whole year later than planned. But that 12-month postponement has inadvertently helped it land exactly at a time that can benefit from it the most. Wonder Woman 1984 is a film with a heart full of hope and love; a nostalgic look back to a beloved time that provides escapism from an exceptionally difficult year. The adherence to a more classic superhero template means it is lacking in any genuine surprise or outstanding innovation, but this approach is always filtered through Jenkins’ contemporary lens, which lends it distinct humanity amongst the ‘80s cheese. A notable improvement on its already great predecessor, Wonder Woman 1984 is exactly the kind of bright and hopeful movie the character’s legacy deserves.

-[Matt Purslow, IGN](https://www.ign.com/articles/wonder-woman-1984-review): 8.0 ""great""

> This is an epically long and epically brash film from director and co-writer Patty Jenkins, but Gadot has a queenly self-possession and she imposes her authority on it.

> A vibrant and virtuous adventure packed with all the heart and heroism we’ve come to expect from DC’s shining light. Wonder Woman 1984 really is the hero 2020 needed all along.

-[Ben Travis, Empire](https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/wonder-woman-1984/): 4/5

> Director Patty Jenkins has followed that original film... with something much longer, cornier and wobblier, but which is energised with a streak of pure movie-star enchantment that recalls the sparkly-eyed uplift of the Christopher Reeve Superman films.

-[Robbie Collin, The Telegraph](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/0/wonder-woman-1984-review-superhero-spectacle-save-cinemas/): 3/5

> Not unlike its predecessor, this film’s finale is overwrought, its stakes overdrawn — even though, maddeningly, they really don’t need to be when the essential conflict is so clear and compelling. Perhaps inevitably, Jenkins herself did not prove immune to the excess that she spent her ambitious 150-minute-long movie denouncing; that runtime alone is more than a little self-indulgent. But hey, if this year has taught us anything, it’s to give each other a break — and to allow ourselves our indulgences. Maybe Wonder Woman will be the one to save us, after all.

-[Mary Sollosi, Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/movies/movie-reviews/wonder-woman-1984-review/): B

> “Wonder Woman 1984” is more than just mere disappointment or let down from the last film, it’s just misguided from the start of its dreamstone plot. Which is such a shame. For all its hopes and dreams, ‘WW84’ has much ambition, but fails to attain the engaging and inspirational greatness it seeks.

-[Rodrigo Perez, The Playlist](https://theplaylist.net/wonder-woman-1984-review-gal-gadot-20201215/): D+

> I do wonder how this would have played in a theater (which you can, technically, still do instead of just watching it on HBO Max.) Because this is a movie of “hijinks” and the actual plot is pretty drawn out. I do wonder if I’d have gotten antsy in a theater, as opposed to sitting on my couch at home where I could have watched another hour of Wonder Woman and Maxwell Lord having a blast. But, that’s not reality right now. And I’m looking at Wonder Woman 1984 as a sort of gift to help all of us get through the pandemic-year holidays. It’s a perfect thing for those of us who can’t make it back home to watch. And, again, Wonder Woman 1984 is pure sugar. There’s little nutritional value. But we all deserve dessert right now.

835,"What are some well liked movies that received a huge amount of backlash? I think Avatar is a huge example of this. The backlash came around when it became the highest grossing movie of all time. People on the internet bashed it for being derivative of Pocohontas and Ferngully.

La La Land got a huge amount of backlash when it became an Oscar juggernaut in 2017. Representatives of various marginalized communities – women, African Americans, and jazz lovers – emerged to take the film down a peg. The first complaints came from the hepcats. The film’s lead character, Sebastian (Ryan Gosling), is a young, white jazz lover who dreams of opening his own club. He’s a traditionalist who harbors dreams of saving jazz by returning it to its roots. Later, in order to show girlfriend Mia (Emma Stone) that he can make a living at his craft, he sells out and agrees to perform in a jazz fusion band led by his friend Keith.

So, this was my first Gaspar Noe film I watched, and I absolutely loved it. Like I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it. All of the reviews on youtube by pretty much everyone under the age of 35 also really loved it, too. I want to show it to my friends and family, but I want to introduce it to them in a way that doesn't spoil anything, but  also prepare them for what they are about to watch. 

My main problem is trying to explain to them that the film will have very little plot and story without spoiling anything. Do I even tell them the genre? I want to introduce it by saying that it's not a movie but rather an experience or a show. I want to tell them this so they aren't worried when there's a 10 minute dance scene without any dialogue in the middle of the movie, and when the camera just hops around characters telling stories about their lives at the party. 

I feel like if I don't tell them that this is more of a visual and sensory experience they will try to think too hard about where the movie is going and what it's trying to say. I think that's a problem because why I enjoyed it so much is that you can turn your brain off and just watch pure cinema for 90 minutes without worrying about where it's going. Yet, they always try to find some meaning or message in the movie.

Any recommendations? I don't want to spoil the real twist in the middle of the movie by telling them what genre the film is. I think I'll just introduce it as ""an immersive experience in which we follow dancers at a party"". Any other suggestions? Thanks!",0

This is a years old problem for me !

Basically back in the 1990's I think, I saw an old war film and I really need help identifying it so I can watch it again... details are sparse I am afraid but I will try and tell you what I remember...

Majority of the film was set in the Jungle... possibly far east during the 2nd world war. Maybe Korean war. Pretty sure film was in technicolour / colour not black and white.

2 main characters .. an american soldier and an oriental soldier...and for most of the film it seemed that they were stuck in a kind of stale mate, pinned down in the Jungle in a hole in the ground  .. with one of the soldiers in one bunker and the other soldier in a nearby bunker too... I think they were trying to throw grenades at each other for much of the time.
